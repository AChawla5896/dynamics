This directory contains the source code for a simple unit test library.
The library contains only header files, in which all member functions
are inlined. 

The design of the library is documented in the class documentation for
the classes UnitTest, TestRunner, and UnitTestRunner.  Three programs 
that illustrate usage are given in the examples/ subdirectory.

Unit tests for particular classes must be derived from UnitTest. Files
that contain definitions of such unit tests must include the files
"UnitTest.h" and "UnitTestRunner.h".
