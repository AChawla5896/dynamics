Simpatico is a C++ package for Monte Carlo (MC), Molecular Dynamics 
(MD) and hybrid MD/MC simulations of classical mechanical models of
polymeric and molecular liquids. It contains:

- Programs for Monte Carlo (MC) and molecular dynamics (MD) 
  simulations on a single processor, named mcSim and mdSim.

- A program for parallel MD simulations, named ddSim.

The parallel MD program ddSim uses a domain decomposition (or
spatial decomposition) parallelization algorithm.

The design of Simpatico was motivated by the following goals: 

- Extensibility: New algorithms may be added for most elements 
  of a simulation via C++ inheritance, without modifying the 
  core source code. Extensible elements include Monte Carlo 
  moves, molecular dynamics integrators, potential energy 
  functions, molecular species, data analysis algorithms, and 
  configuration file formats.

- Efficiency: Simpatico is designed to be competitive as a tool 
  for computationally demanding research projects. 

- Integrating Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics:
  The single processor mcSim and mdSim programs provide efficient
  implementations of both MC and MD algorithms, based on a shared
  code base. The resulting code is particularly suitable for 
  hybrid Monte Carlo (HMC) simulations, in which short MD 
  simulations are used as proposed Monte Carlo moves. 

- Integrated data analysis: mcSim and mdSim come bundled with 
  a set of data analysis classes that can be used either 
  "on-the-fly", during a simulation, or for post-processing
  of configurations that were dumped to file during an earlier
  simulation.
   
Simpatico source code may be obtained either by download from 
the project website
<http://research.cems.umn.edu/morse/code/simpatico/home.php> 
or by cloning a copy of the git version control repository.  
The code is standard C++ and must be compiled from source. 
Multi-processor programs (ddSim and multi-processor versions 
of mcSim and mdSim) require an MPI library.

Web documentation is provided with downloadable releases, in the
directory simpatico/doc/html, but is not retained in the git 
repository. Instructions for regenerating the html documentation,
if needed, is given below. A copy of the html docmentation is 
also accessible via the Simpatico web page.

Compiling:
----------

Instructions for compiling Simpatico are given in the text file 
simpatico/doc/dox/compile.dox, or in the corresponding html web 
page in the doc/html directory, which is generated from this text 
file.  Short instructions for compiling the default single-processor 
versions of mcSim and mdSim (for the impatient) are:

- cd to the simpatico/ root directory

- Enter "./configure" to run a configure script

- cd to the src/ directory

- Enter "make mcMd".

The resulting executables, name "mcSim" and "mdSim", will be 
installed in the simpatico/bin directory. Further instructions
for compiling multi-processor programs, and for enabling or
disabling various features, are given in the file 
simpatico/dox/dox/compile.dox and in the corresponding html page. 

Documentation:
--------------

Web documentation for Simpatico is prepared using the Doxygen 
utility (www.doxygen.org). Doxygen creates html web pages that 
are deposited in the directory doc/html/.  These pages are created 
from comments extracted from the C++ source code, and from a set 
of *.dox files in the directory simpatico/doc/dox/, which contain 
the text for a set of introductory web pages. These *.dox files 
are readable in any text editor.  The html pages are included in 
the downloadable distribution, but are not retained in the git 
repository.  

If you are using a downloaded version, you can read the web
documentation by pointing a browser at any *.html file in the 
directory simpatico/doc/html, and then using the links at the 
top of any page to navigate to the main manual page.  The html 
file for the main page is named index.html.

If you are using a clone of the git source code repository, you 
can use dOxygen to regenerate the html documentation.  The file 
simpatico/doc/dox/compile.dox contains instructions for how to
do so. This requires that dOxygen be installed and that the
executable be in a directory in your PATH. The basic instructions 
(after dOxygen is installed) are:

  - cd to the simpatico/src directory
  - Enter "make doc"
