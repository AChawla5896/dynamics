Simpatico source code may be obtained either by download from the 
project website or (for developers) by cloning a copy of the git 
version control repository.  The code must be compiled from source. 

Web documentation is provided with downloadable releases, in the
directory simpatico/doc/html, but is not retained in the git 
repository. Developer/users who are using a clone of the git 
repository may want to regenerate the documentation. Instructions
for doing so below.  A coy of the html docmentation is also 
accessible via the Simpatico web page.


Compiling:
---------

Instructions for compiling Simpatico are given in the text file
src/dox/compile.dox, or in the corresponding html web page in 
the doc/html directory, which is generated from this text file.

Documentation:
--------------

Web documentation for Simpatico is prepared using the Doxygen 
utility (www.doxygen.org). Doxygen creates html web pages that 
are deposited in the directory doc/html/.  These pages are created 
from comments extracted from the C++ source code, and from a set 
of *.dox files in the directory simpatico/src/dox/, which contain 
the text for a set of introductory web pages. The *.dox files are 
readable in any text editor.  The html pages are included in the 
downloadable distribution, but are not retained in the git 
repository.  

If you are using a downloaded version, you can read it by pointing 
a browser at any *.html file in the simpatico/doc/html directory, 
and then using the links at the top of any page to navigate to 
the main manual page.  The html file for the main page is called 
index.html.

If you are using a clone of the git source code repository, you 
may want to use dOxygen to regenerate the html documentation.  
Before, or instead of, regenerating the html pages, you can 
also begin by use a text editor to readi the corresponding
*.dox source files src/dox directory, which contain the text
of the introductory html pages. 

The file src/dox/compile.dox contains instructions for how to 
use dOxygen to regenerate the html documentation, if necessary. 
This requires that dOxygen be installed and that the doxygen
executable be in a directory in your $PATH environment variable. 

The basic instructions (after installing dOxygen) are:

  - cd to the src/ directory
  - type "make doc"
