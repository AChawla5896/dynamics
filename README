Simpatico is a C++ package for Monte Carlo (MC), Molecular Dynamics 
(MD) and hybrid MD/MC simulations of classical mechanical models of
polymeric and molecular liquids. It contains:

- Programs for Monte Carlo (MC) and molecular dynamics (MD) 
  simulations on a single processor, named mcSim and mdSim.

- A program for parallel MD simulations, named ddSim.

The parallel MD program ddSim uses a domain (or spatial) 
decomposition algorithm for parallelization.

Design Goals:
-------------

The design of Simpatico was motivated by the following goals: 

- Extensibility: New algorithms may be added for most elements 
  of a simulation via C++ inheritance, without modifying the 
  core source code. Extensible elements include Monte Carlo 
  moves, molecular dynamics integrators, potential energy 
  functions, molecular species, data analysis algorithms, and 
  configuration file formats.

- Efficiency: Simpatico is designed to be competitive as a tool 
  for computationally demanding research projects. 

- Integrating Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics:
  The single processor mcSim and mdSim programs provide efficient
  implementations of MC, MD, and hybrid integration algorithms, 
  based on a shared code base. 

- Integrated data analysis: mcSim and mdSim come bundled with 
  a set of data analysis classes that can be used either 
  "on-the-fly", during a simulation, or for post-processing.
   
Getting the Source Code:
------------------------

Simpatico source code may be obtained either by downloading 
a tarball from github project web page
<http://dmorse.github.com/simpatico/index.html> 
or by using git to cloning a working tree from
<https://github.com/dmorse/simpatico>.
Either method gets you a current copy of the master branch
from the git repository.

If you download a tarball, the tar file will be named something
like dmorse-simpatico-commit.tar, where "commit" denotes a
denotes a hexadecimal identifier for the most recent commit 
to the git repository.  When you extract the tar file
(tar -xvf), the source files will be extracted into a directory 
with the same name, dmorse-simpatico-commit/.  In order to 
create the same directory structure as that used in the 
repository, in which the root directory is named simpatico/
you should rename this root directory to simpatico/ before 
running the ./configure script. You thus need to enter:
\code
   tar -xvf dmorse-simpatico-commit.tar
   mv  dmorse-simpatico-commit simpatico
\endcode
from the directory that should contain the simpatico root
directory.  If you mv the root directory after running the 
configure script (see below), you must rerun the script. 

Documentation:
--------------

Web pages that provide both user and developer documentation for
Simpatico is prepared using the Doxygen utility (www.doxygen.org). 
Doxygen creates html web pages that are deposited in the directory 
doc/html/ of the working tree. These pages are created from 
comments extracted from the C++ source code, and from a set of 
text files in the directory doc/dox/. These text files, which 
have the file extension *.dox, contain the text for a set of 
introductory documentation pages, and are readable in any text 
editor. 

A recent copy of the documentation is available online, at
<http://dmorse.github.com/simpatico/index.html>.

After getting a copy of the source code (either by download or by 
cloning the git repository), you can use dOxygen to generate a 
local copy of the html documentation within the simpatico/doc/html 
directory of the source code tree.  This requires that dOxygen 
be installed on your computer and that the executable be in a 
directory in your PATH. The basic instructions (after dOxygen is 
installed) are:

  - cd to the simpatico/doc directory
  - Enter "make doc"

This should create a large set of html files in the 
simpatico/doc/html directory. To begin reading the documentation, 
point a browser at the file simpatico/doc/html/index.html.

Compiling:
----------

The code is standard C++ and must be compiled from source. 
Multi-processor programs (ddSim and multi-processor versions 
of mcSim and mdSim) require an MPI library.
Instructions for compiling Simpatico are given in the text file 
simpatico/doc/dox/compile.dox, or in the corresponding html web 
page in the doc/html directory, which is generated from this text 
file. 

Short instructions for compiling the default single-processor 
versions of mcSim and mdSim (for the impatient) are:

- cd to the simpatico root directory

- Enter "./configure" to run a configure script

- cd to the src/ directory

- Enter "make mcMd".

The resulting executables, name "mcSim" and "mdSim", will be 
installed in the simpatico bin/ directory. Further instructions
for compiling multi-processor programs, and for enabling or
disabling various features, are given in the file 
doc/dox/compile.dox and in the corresponding html page.
