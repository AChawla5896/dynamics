TODO:

1) Re-organize user guide to make it easier for users find what they 
   are looking for. Possible organization (think about this again):

    3.1  - Running a Simulation (good)
    3.2  - Parameter Files (good)
    3.3  - Command Files (good)
    3.4  - Configuration Files (good)
    3.5  - Examples (good)
   *3.6  - Interactions (Potential Energies)
   *3.7  - Molecular Dynamics Integrators 
         - ddSim integrators
         - mdSim integrators
   *3.8  - Monte Carlo Moves 
         - mcSim McMoves 
   *3.9  - Molecular Species
   *3.10 - Data Analysis
           Explain use of analyzers, briefly postprocessing
           3.10.1 analyzers page
                - Analyzers for mdSim or mcSim
                - Analyzers for ddSim 
           3.10.2 trajectories page
           3.10.3 Postprocessing with mdSim or mcSim
           3.10.4 Postprocessing with mdPp
   *3.10 - Generating Initial Configurations  <- new, explain command syntax
    3.12 - Restarting
    3.13 - Multi-System Simulations
   *3.14 - Perturbation (new)
   *3.15 - Class Documentation (new - explain where to find information)

2) Document all of the analyzers, with one *.dox file per interaction 
   in new directories doc/analyzers/ddMd and doc/analyzers/mcMd.

3) Document changes to the parameter file format caused by enabling 
   particular features. This requires creating a *.dox file for every
   subclass of ParamComposite and finding a place to list them all as
   subpages. Create lists in Source Code Overview and reference 
   elsewhere?
