/*! \page test_page Unit Tests

The src/test/ directory contain source code for a simple unit test framework.
This framework can be used to test MPI parallel programs as well as single
processor classes and programs.  Documentation for the test framework is
provided within the header files in the src/test directory, and in several 
examples in the src/test/examples directory.

Actual unit tests are located in the simpatico/tests/ directory. This contains
a directory treee analogous to that of the src/ directory, in which the test 
for each class is located in a position analogous to that of the source files
in the src/ directory.  Unit tests are not compiled by the makefile system that 
is used to compile the classes needed for simulation. Tests may be compiled
separately by invoking "make all" from the subdirectory containing a particular
test. This generally creates an executable named "Test" that runs all of the 
tests in that directory.
