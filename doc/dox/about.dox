/*! \page about_page About Simpatico

Simpatico is a library of C++ classes and programs for Monte 
Carlo and molecular dynamics simulations of molecular and
polymer liquids. It contains the following main programs:

- Programs for Monte Carlo (MC) and molecular dynamics (MD) 
  simulations on a single processor.

- A program for parallel MD simulations, using a domain
  decomposition algorithm.

The single-processor MC and MD programs are named mcSim and mdSim, 
respectively. These programs can also execute replica exchange
simulations in which each of processors simulates a different 
replica of the system.  The parallel domain decomposition MD 
program is called ddSim.  ddSim is a recent addition to the 
package, and is less mature than that the other two programs. 
Simpatico is distributed under the terms of the GNU public 
license (see the LICENSE file). 

The design of Simpatico was motivated by the following goals: 

- Extensibility: New algorithms may be added for most elements 
  of a simulation via C++ inheritance, without modifying the 
  core source code.  Extensible elements of a simulation include 
  Monte Carlo moves, molecular dynamics integrators, potential 
  energy functions, molecular species, data analysis algorithms, 
  and configuration file formats.

- Efficiency: Simpatico is designed to be competitive as a tool 
  for computationally demanding research projects. 

- Integrated Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics:
  The single processor mcSim and mdSim programs use similar data
  structures to provide efficient implementations of both MC and 
  MD algorithms. They are thus particularly suitable for hybrid 
  Monte Carlo (HMC) algorithms, in which short MD simulations are 
  used as proposed Monte Carlo moves. Simpatico also provides an 
  module that allows the HOOMD-blue code for MD on graphical 
  processing units (GPUs) to be used as an engine for very fast 
  hybrid MC simulations.

- Integrated data analysis: mcSim and mdSim come bundled with 
  a set of data analysis classes that can all be used either 
  "on-the-fly", during a simulation, or by using the same two
  programs for post-processing of trajectory files.

The design of mcSim and mdSim (which share a great deal of code) 
is similar in many ways to that of 
<a href=http://www.etomica.org>Etomica</a>, 
which was written in Java by David Kofke's group at the University 
of Buffalo.  
The domain decomposition algorithm used in ddSim is similar to
that used in LAMMPS.

Simpatico is a young project, and lacks some features found in 
any of several more mature molecular dynamics packages, such as 
Lammps, NAMD, Gromacs, and Espresso, and in a smaller number of
MC packages, such as Towhee. It has thus far been used only for
simulations of coarse-grained bead-spring models of polymer 
liquids.
