Blocks in configuration file:

BOUNDARY:

   [Boundary]

ATOMS: 

   [molecular
    nSpecies int
    for each species {
       nMolecule  nAtom
    }
   ]
   [ordered]
   nAtom integer
   format [i][m][t]p[v][s][c]

   Format flags:
   i = global id (tag)                   only required for DdMd
   m = context (species, molecule, atom) only required for DdMd
   t = type id                           only required for DdMd
   p = position                          always required
   v = velocity                          required by MD simulations
   s = shift                             optional for MD simulations
   c = charge                            (possibility, for future)

   Comments:

   1) The molecular and ordered flags are optional, and are set 
      false by default.

   2) The ordered flag is implied if molecular is already set, and
      is not required if molecular is set.

   3) The presence of the molecular block indicates that atom ids are 
   in molecular order, consecutive within each molecule, molecules of 
   the same species consecutive within a block.

   4) The ddSim program will write the molecular block if the input 
   configuration was read from a file that contained it. It will 
   thus preserve and output molecular ordering, if it can.

   5) The default output formats for different simulation programs:

       mdSim writes all of the above, including shift when known
       mcSim writes all of the above except velocity and shift
       ddSim writes all that it can (context and shift optional)

BONDS, ANGLES, or DIHEDRALS:
   
   [molecular
    nSpecies int
    for each species {
       nMolecule  nGroup
    }
   ]
   [ordered]
   nGroup  int
   For each {
      groupId atomId0 ... atomId(N-1) typeId
   }

   The format is essentially the same for each type of covalent bond, 
   except for the block label BONDS, ANGLES, or DIHEDRALS.

   The meaning of the optional molecular block and optional ordered
   flag are similar to those for atoms.
