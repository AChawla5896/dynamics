For configuration files:

   1) SmpConfigWriter for McMd. This will allow config files
      to be generated. 
 
   2) Write AtomSpecies and GroupSpecies classes for DdMd.
      Add arrays of these objects to DdMd::Simulation to 
      allow them to be stored.

   3) Write SmpConfigReader and SmpConfigWriter for DdMd. 
      These should only store number of molecules per block
      and number of atoms/groups per molecule. The reader 
      should populate the AtomSpecies and GroupSpecies classes 
      from information in the config file, if provided.

For trajectory files:

   1) Write trajectory file writer for DdMd.

   2) Write trajectory file reader and writer for McMd.

For topology file, if any:

   1) Define a Tools::Species class in which block information
      can be stored.  Write code to infer topology from first
      molecule of a configuration file that is in molecular 
      order. Parameter file or read separate topology file?

   2) Question: Is the Species class in the Tools namespace
      the same as the one in the McMd namespace? Should we
      share or duplicate code? Possible difference: Topology
      information may be absent. What is required?

   3) Decide on method(s) of reading topology information from
      file into a postprocessor for use with a trajectory file. 
      Options:

         - Parameter file (as in McMd)
         - Topology file(s)

      Proposal:

         Create a topology file text format analogous to 
         that used for the Species base class in the McMd 
         param file, but with fewer spaces (e.g., labels 
         can be on separate lines above data).

         Create a Tools::Species class that can read and
         write this format.

         Allow McMd::Species to read and write this 
         information.

Force field file (?):

    Consider creating another ForceField format to allow 
    communication of potential energy parameters and atom 
    labelling schemes between programs.

    Provide mechanism for McMd and DdMd programs to read
    in the force field before reading in remaining parameters
    of the potential energy.
