      nAtom int
      headerFormat - bitfield indicating which optional info follows
      [MOLECULE] - nMolecule & nAtom per molecule, iff isMolecular 
      [ATOM] 
         format - bitfield with flags hasMass and hasCharge
         For each atom{
            typeId, [mass], [charge]
         }

      nAtom int
      frameFormat - bitfield with flags that include: isMolecular,
                    isOrdered, hasShift, hasVelocity, hasCharge, 
                    hasMolecule, hasSpecial
      ATOMS (id, position, optionally shift, velocity)
         For each atom {
           id position (scaled, as 3xuint) [shift 3 x small int] [velocity]
         }
         Note: Position is stored in scaled coordinates, as 3 x uint
               Shift, if present, is 3 x small int
               Velocity, if present, is 3 x single precision float
