Proposal for changing Buffer (May 17, 2013).

class Buffer:

1) Make pack and unpack method templates public.

2) Add public endItem() method to increment sendSize_.

3) Make these functions members of Atom or Group:
   (pack|unpack)Atom(), (pack|unpack)Ghost,
   (pack|unpack)Force(), (pack|unpack)Group,
   atomSize(), ghostSize(), groupSize()

4) Remove atomCapacity and group Capacity - these quantities
   can be calculated outside the class.

5) Allocate explicitly in terms of bytes.

6) Add int groupId(int N) to calculate enum for Group<N>

7) Change block prefix. Currently contains:

   - sendSize_
   - sendType_
   - sendGroupSize_ (often unused)
   - isComplete_

   Make it instead:

   - sendSize_    = number of items.
   - sendBytes_   = length of data block in bytes.
   - sendType_    = integer value
   - isComplete_  = used by distributor and collector
