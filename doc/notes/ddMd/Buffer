Plans for changing Buffer and dependent classes (May 2, 2011).

class Buffer:

1) Add private pointers to contain more complete description of buffer.

   change private members:

       void* sendBuffer_ to sendBufferBegin_
       void* recvBuffer_ to sendBufferBegin_

   add private members:

       void* sendBufferEnd_
       void* recvBufferEnd_

2) Change pack() template so as to check for the end of the buffer.

3) Change send() and sendRecv() so as to calculate buffer size from 
   sendPtr_.

4) Add private pointers that refer to the current block, if any.

       void* sendBlockBegin_
       void* recvBlockBegin_

5) Change names of type enumeration and type variables

       Rename: AtomTypeName  -> BlockTypeName
       Rename: atomSendType_ -> blockSendType_
       Rename: atomRecvType_ -> blockRecvType_

6) Rename initSendBuffer(AtomTypeName) -> beginSendBlock(BlockTypeName)

   Change function calls in Distributor, Exchanger, and Collector.

7) Add method endSendBlock(). This should:

      set blockSendSize_ and blockSendType_ values in buffer.
      set sendBlockBegin_ = 0
      set BlockTypeName = NONE

      Remove these operations from send()
      Add function calls in Distributor, before send calls.

      Remove these operations from sendRecv()
      Add function calls in Exchanger, before sendRecv() calls.
