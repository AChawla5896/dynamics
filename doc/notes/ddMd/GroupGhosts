Issues:

 1) For grid directions with 1 processor, no ghosts are sent to complete 
    groups. Groups may be completed using long bonds, relying on minimum
    image convention. This special case has thus far required use of the
    minimum image convention for all cases. 

 2) For grid directions with 2 processors, one the first step, the current 
    algorithm allows atoms in incomplete groups to be sent in both directions.
    This means that the receiving processor will receive two images with
    shifted coordinates. The group is completed using a pointer to the first
    atom with the correct Id, which may not be the one that would not require
    a minimum image convention.  For atoms near an edge or corner, there can
    be more than 2 images. 

Principles:

 1) For any number of processors, always create bonded ghosts. 

 2) For each direction, for 1 or 2 processors, send all members of the 
    group in the same sense (j=0 or j=1). Try to choose this such that 
    no shifts are required to complete the group. (How to do this?)

 3) For one and two processor cases: Identify uncoupled atoms, i.e., atoms
    connected to incomplete bonds. Find the uncoupled atom that is closest
    to a boundary. Send all local atoms in the direction of the boundary
    for this atom. 

 4) Modify the algorithm on the receiving end so as to check the minimum
    image convention immediately as each atom is added. Reject images 
    that do not satisfy the minimum image convention. Throw an Exception
    if it is not possible to find images that satisfy the minimum image
    convention. 

 5) When trying to complete a Group, search in a specific order: Look 
    first for atoms that are connected to at least one existing atom,
    then repeat the process until the group is complete. This allows
    minimum image convention for bonds to be satisfied at each step.

    Problem with 4 and 5: The method for finding atoms only allows us to
    identify one image of each atom. For a 2 x 2 x 2 grid, we will receive
    up to 8 images. Will the problem will be solved if we require that 
    each atom is sent in only one direction? Well, no, since a particle
    near an corner in a 1 x 1 x 1 grid really should appear 6 times?

 6) Consider writing specific instantiations of GroupStorage::findGhosts
    for different values of N, to reduce the number of if{...} blocks.

 7) Decide what to do if an atom must be sent in one direction as a result
    of rule (3) and sent in the other as a result of proximity to a boundary.
