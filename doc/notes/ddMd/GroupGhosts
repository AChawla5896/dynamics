Issues:

 1) For grids with 1 or 2 processors in one or more directions, a 
    processor may contain mor than one atom images (local or ghost) 
    of the same atom, with the same atom id. Currently, a group is 
    completed with local atoms if possible and, if not, completed
    with ghosts. The method for finding ghosts does not search among
    multiple ghosts with the same id: It chooses the first ghost 
    atom with the correct id.  The selected image may not be the one 
    that would satify the minimum convention. As a result, the 
    inner force loop for groups in BondPotentialImpl etc. must 
    impose the minimum image convention. 

 2) For grids that contain only 1 processor in one or more direction,
    a processor may contain more than one images of the same atom even
    for nonbonded ghosts.  A processor may contain either a local atom 
    and one or more ghosts or more than one ghost and no local atom. 

 3) For grid directions with only 1 processor, ghosts are not sent to
    complete groups.

 4) For grid directions with 2 processors, one the first step, the current 
    algorithm requires atoms in incomplete groups to be sent in both directions.
    This means that the receiving processor will receive two images of each
    such atom with shifted coordinates. 

 5) The algorithm for checking which boundaries a group spans, at the
    beginning of exchangeAtoms, uses the pointers to group atoms defined
    when the group was completed, and does not check the minimum image
    convention. The decision regarding which boundaries a group spans
    effect communication on later steps. Long bonds created on the first 
    step can thus persist long after the first step.

 6) The communication of so many non-bonded ghosts on the first step
    requires a larger communication buffer than required on subsequent 
    steps.

Proposals:

 1) Modify AtomStorage so as to retain a record of all ghost images (Done).

 2) Create ghosts to complete groups even in directions with one processor

 3) For each direction, for 1 or 2 processors, try send connected members 
    of the group in the same sense (j=0 or j=1).  Identify uncoupled atoms, 
    i.e., atoms connected to incomplete bonds. Find the uncoupled atom that 
    is closest to a boundary. Send all local atoms in the direction of the 
    boundary for this atom. 

 4) Modify the algorithm for completing groups so as to check the minimum
    image convention, by checking all ghosts until one is found that 
    satisfies the minimum image convention. Throw an Exception if none is 
    found.  Algorithm: First complete the group using a single pointer to 
    each atom (the one in AtomMap::atomPtrs_). Then identify a root atom 
    and check minimum image convention for each bond in sequence, working 
    outward from the root atom. For each bond for which the initial choice
    does not satisfy the minimum image convention, try all ghosts. Throw 
    an exception if none of them satisfy the minimum image convention for 
    a bond. 

 5) Consider writing specific instantiations of GroupStorage::findGhosts 
    for different values of N, to reduce the number of if{...} blocks.

 6) Write a new function Exchanger::initialGhostExchange() that will be
    called just before the first step. This method would first exchange
    all nonbonded ghosts, and unset each bit of their plan upon receipt.
    After receiving nonbonded ghosts, it would add these to incomplete
    groups, choosing from among images so as to satisfy the minimum
    image convention.  Then, it would send atoms from groups that are 
    still incomplete to neighboring processors, and complete groups on 
    receipt, as in the current first step. The final step would be a
    final all-to-all communication confirming that all groups are 
    complete and satisfy the minimum image convention an all processors.

    Because multiple images of nonbonded ghosts may be received in
    systems with only one processor in some directions, the function
    that completes groups on receipt of ghosts will require an 
    algorithm for choosing from among images when completing a group 
    using nonbonded ghosts. This algorithm needs to be worked out, but 
    the same algorithm can be used during this initial exchange as 
    during subsequent exchanges. Because some groups will be incomplete
    after the first stage of exchange in the initial exchange, the
    function should not throw an Exception as soon as it fails to
    complete a group, but should return a value indicating success
    or failure, which would be checked only after the final ghost
    exchange.

    In the final step of sending atoms from incomplete groups, we 
    would like to avoid sending atoms from incomplete groups in all 27
    directions. To do this, the algorithm would require a mechanism for 
    deciding in which of two possible senses to send atoms from 
    incomplete groups for each Cartesian direction.

    Algorithm for receiving ghosts, AtomMap::findGroupGhostAtoms

       Choose a root atom from among local atoms;
       Iterate over bonds going down from root {
          checkout minimum image convention;
          if (not minimum image) {
             search ghosts
          }
       }
       Iterate over bonds going up from root {
          checkout minimum image convention;
          if (not minimum image) {
             search ghosts
          }
       }

    Algorithm for sending ghosts, in GroupStorage::markGroupGhosts()

    For each incomplete group {
       For each direction {
          middle = 0.5*(bound(i,1) + bound(i,0))
          min0 = 1000000.0
          min1 = 1000000.0
          for each atom in group{
             if present {
                if connected to absent atom {
                   coordinate = atomPtr->position(i);
                   if (coordinate > middle) {
                      diff = upper - coordinat
                      if (diff < min1) {
                         diff = min1;
                      }
                   } else {
                      diff = coordinate - lower;
                      if (diff < min0) {
                         diff = min0;
                      }
                   }
                }
             }
          }
          if (min0 < min1) {
            mark local atoms for sending in direction 0;
          } else {
            mark local atoms for sending in direction 0;
          }
       }
       
    }

    Note that this algorithm would use all available information about
    atom positions, including nonbonded ghosts as well as local atoms.

    ghosts.
