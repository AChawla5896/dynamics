Proposal: Allow periodic sorting local atoms by the order in which they
appear in the cell list, ordering cells by conventional grid order. This
corresponds to the use of strips in construction of the pair list. 

Question: Is it possible or advisable to try to sort ghost atoms, since 
these are recreated after every reneighboring anyway? If we don't sort
the ghosts, much of the advantage of sorting is lost.

Question: Should sorting occur during the exchange, after exchanging atoms
but before exchanging ghosts, to minimize the cost of the sort?
