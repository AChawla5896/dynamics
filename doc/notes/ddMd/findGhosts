Goal:

   Allow atomStorage::findGhosts to find image of each atom
   that minimizes the bond lengths, avoiding the need for a
   minimum image convention.

Proposal:

   Rewrite AtomMap::findGroupGhostAtoms so as to find images
   that satisfy the minimum image convention.

      DArray<Vector> positions
      DArray<bool>   isLocal
      DArray<bool>   isKnown

      - Iterate through all atoms.

          - If present (local) store position.
          - If absent (ghost), find ghost and store position.

      - Choose one local atom as the root atom. Different conventions
        can be used for different values of N.

      - Make a plan for order in which to investigate remaining atoms
        and bonds, and which bonds to check for each.

      - For each atom in plan, check minimum image. 

      - If not satisfied, find extra images and iterate.

      - If no image satisfies minimum image convention, throw Exception.
