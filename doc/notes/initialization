Types:

    DArray<AtomType> atomTypes_;
    int nAtomType_;
    int nBondType_;
    int nAngleType_;
    int nDihedralType_;
    int hasExternal_;
    int hasTether_;
    maskedPairPolicy_;

SpeciesManager speciesManagerPtr_;

Random random_;

    Call initialize() after has types and speciesManager.

Requirements:: 

    Types and SpeciesManager can be added in either order.
    initialize() can be called only once, after:

       Types are added and initialized.
       SpeciesManger is initialized.

    Access random() via a pointer, so it can be shared.

Methods:

    SetTypes(&const Types types);
      Use a pointer.

    SetSpeciesManager(SpeciesManager);

    Rename initialize() -> allocate(). Make public, put in
    strong tests.
