Goal: Design files that can be used by multiple programs within
the Simpatico package.

Requirements / proposals:

   - Design three shared file types: configuration (initialization), 
     trajectory (analysis), and topology (molecule structure).

   - Don't worry about compatibility with other MD programs - this
     is a separate problem, to be handled separately

   - Self-documenting configuration and trajectory formats (allows 
     adaptation and validation) with several format variants. A single 
     class should be able to read any usable variant of this format, 
     with appropriate error checking.

   - Configuration and trajectory files that are intended for use
     by McMd programs must have atom ids in "canonical" molecule order.
     This requires that atom ids are consecutive from 0, ordered with
     atoms in the same molecule labelled in a consecutive block, and
     molecules of the same species listed consecutively, and with ids
     of corresponding atoms ordered in the same way within molecules
     of the same type. Files that obey this convention for atom ids 
     should document this fact, and should indicate the number of 
     molecules of each species and the number of atoms per molecule. 

   - Configuration files may or may not contain "ordered", implying 
     that atoms with consecutive ids appear consecutively in the file. 
     Note that the question of whether the file format is ordered, 
     which is a property of the order in which atoms appear within a 
     file, is independent of whether the atom indices themselves are
     in "canonical" order, which is a property of how index values 
     are assigned to atoms. A configuration file can be ordered 
     without having canonical atom indices or can contain canonical
     atom indices without being ordered. Files that are ordered 
     should document this fact in the file format descriptor. 

   - DdMd will need to be able to read, store, and write back out
     basic information about species (number of molecules of each
     type, and number of atoms per molecule) in order to allow it
     to validate (on input) and document (on output) that a 
     configuration is in canonical molecular order.

   - McMd programs should read configuration and trajectory format
     variants produced by DdMd (ordered or disordered). The reader
     should require only that atom ids be in canonical molecule
     order, but not that atoms be ordered consecutively by id 
     in the config file.

   - McMd programs should write a configuration format that can be 
     used to initialize DdMd, which must include groups. Atom ids
     used in this format must be in canonical molecular order, and
     should also be ordered (since there is no reason not to). The
     format should contain information about species and molecule
     sizes.

   - MdPp should read all configuration and trajectory formats 
     produced by DdMd, with atom ids in canonical molecule order 
     or not, and should be able to make use of molecule information 
     when it is available.

   - Configuration files can be asii files, and somewhat verbose, but 
     trajectory formats should be binary and very compact. Only 
     trajectory formats are intended for use for data analysis.

   - Allow but do not require trajectory files to contain a header
     with configuration information (molecule and species sizes, 
     fixed atom info (types, etc.), groups). Readers should check 
     for consistency of redundant data.

   - Provide a separate topology file format. This can be written
     by (md|mc)Sim and read by MdPp for molecule based analysis. 
     It will not normally be used by ddSim, except perhaps by a
     SnapShot, for on-the-fly analysis.

Configuration file (ascii):

   BOUNDARY (same as current)
   [MOLECULES] - presence of this block indicates canonical atom id order
   ATOMS - format variable, indicated within block
   [BONDS]
   [LINKS]
   [ANGLES]
   [DIHEDRALS]

Trajectory file (binary):

   Header:
      nAtom int
      frameFormat - bitfield with flags that include: molecular?, 
                     fixed? ordered?, velocity? shift? (other?)
      headerFormat - bitfield indicating which optional info follows
      [MOLECULES] - molecule & species sizes, required iff molecular 
      [ATOMTYPES] - Format, followed by per atom: typeId, [charge]
      [BONDS][ANGLES][DIHEDRALS]
   Frame:
      iStep
      boundary
      ATOMS (id, position, optionally shift, velocity)

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Blocks in configuration file:

BOUNDARY:

   [Boundary]

SPECIES:

   [hasBonds]
   [hasAngles]
   [hasDihedrals]
   nSpecies  [int]

   for each species { 
      speciesId  nMolecule nAtom [nBond] [nAngle] [nDihedral]
   }

   Comments /

   1) The presence of this block indicates that atom and group ids
   are in molecular order.

   2) The flags hasBonds, hasAngles, and hasDihedrals are optional,
   and are all set false by default.

   3) For each species, the variables nBond, nAngle, and nDihedral 
   are each required if and only if the associated flag hasBonds, 
   hasAngles, or hasDihedrals is set.

   4) The ddSim program will write this block if the input configuration
   was read from a file which contained it. It will thus preserve and
   output molecular ordering, if it can.

ATOMS: 

   [ORDERED]
   FORMAT [i][m][t]p[v][s][c]
   NATOM integer

   Format flags:
   i = global id (tag)                   only required for DdMd
   m = context (species, molecule, atom) only required for DdMd
   t = type id                           only required for DdMd
   s = shift                             optional for MD simulations
   p = position                          always required
   v = velocity                          required by MD simulations
   c = charge                            (possibility, for future)

   Comments:

   1) The ORDERED flag is optional, and is set false by default.

   2) The default output formats for different simulation programs:

       mdSim writes all of the above, including shift when known
       mcSim writes all of the above except velocity and shift
       ddSim writes all that it can (context and shift optional)

       Note: ddSim must know if atoms are in canonical molecular order

BONDS, ANGLES, or DIHEDRALS:
   
   [ORDERED]
   NGROUP   int
   For each {
      atomId0 ... atomId(N-1) typeId
   }

   The format is essentially the same for each type of covalent bond,
   except for the block label BONDS, ANGLES, or DIHEDRALS.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Trajectory frame format:

   FRAME:
     For each atom {
        id position(scaled, as 3xuint) [shift 3 x int] [velocity]
     }

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Plan:

   1) McMd ConfigIo for configuration format      (SpcConfigIo)
   2) McMd TrajectoryIo for trajectory format     (SptTrajectoryIo)
   3) Add simple species to DdMd::Simulation
   4) DdMd ConfigIo for configuration format      (SpcConfigIo)
   5) DdMd Writer for trajectory format           (SptTrajectoryWriter)
   6) Tools reader                                (SptTrajectoryReader)
   7) Allow optional arguments in command lines
   8) Divide readers and writers for McMd
