Proposed ParamComposite Changes:
--------------------------------

- Change C-array to std::vector in the implementation of ParamComposite.

- Add a private className_ variable to ParamComposite that is set by a 
  protected method inside the constructor of each subclass, and read by 
  a public accessor.
  
- Add a virtual method readParameters(std::istream&) to ParamComposite,
  which reads parameters with no readBegin() and readEnd() statements.
  Make default implementation of readParam() call this, using a stored
  class name to set the class name. Start transforming readParam methods
  of existing classes to the new system, by adding a class name to each, 
  and renaming readParam -> readParameters. The old readParam methods 
  will continue to work fine until transformation is complete.

- Develop a way to allow optional parameters in a parameter file.  Use 
  the same mechanism for polymorphic classes. (See notes about this).
