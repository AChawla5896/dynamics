Proposed compatibility breaking changes:
---------------------------------------

- Method names:
 
   (1) Reconsider interface for Random, e.g., getFloat() -> uniform().

   Why: Consistency. The "get" prefix is not used elsewhere in the
   code. These functions are only called in a limited number of 
   places within the package, so the change does not look difficult.

- File locations:

  (1) Reorganize util subdirectories. Separate directories for 
  string, observer, misc.
