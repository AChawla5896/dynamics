Proposed compatibility breaking changes:
---------------------------------------

- Param file format:

    (1) Require bondtype parameter for homopolymers and diblocks.

    Why: Currently, all bonds are taken to be bond type 0. This is
    an entirely arbitrary hack. The only alternative is to specify
    the bond type explicitly.

- Method names:
 
   (1) Reconsider interface for Random, e.g., getFloat() -> uniform().

   Why: Consistency. The "get" prefix is not used elsewhere in the
   code. These functions are only called in a limited number of 
   places within the package, so the change does not look difficult.

- File locations:

  (1) Reorganize util subdirectories. Separate directories for 
  string, observer, misc.
