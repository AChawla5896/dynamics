How is an EeMcSimulation different from an McSimulation?
Can one be a subclass of the other?

Class EeMcSimatulation : public Simulation {

   Has a Perturbation (required)

   Has an ExtendedEnsemble (required)

   Has an EeDiagnosticManager

   Has some sort of method to periodically
       update free energy estimates.

   Has a simulate or run method that is based
       on the idea of "sweeps", in which free
       energy estimates are updated after each
       sweep
   

}
