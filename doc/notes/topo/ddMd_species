Species data in DdMd::Simulation
--------------------------------

   - Data for reach species (minimal): Number of molecules of this type,
     number of atoms, bonds, angles, and dihedrals per molecule.

   - Add a member listing the first id for atoms, bonds, etc. for each 
     species. Provide functions allowing conversion between molecule and 
     local atom/group number and global atom/group ids.

   - Data structures: Define class Species. DdMd::Simulation could have
     a DArray<Species> species array, and a bool hasSpecies flag.
 
   - Question: Should there be a way to access more detailed topological 
     information? Possibility: Auxiliary data structure (class MoleculeType)
     that takes a Species as a required parameter to its constructor. The
     Species could have a pointer to the Topology, which would be null if
     no topology exists.

   - Question: What namespace should this be? Should it be accessible to
     both DdMd and Tools? How to prevent name clashes with McMd species?
