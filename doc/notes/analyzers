Idea:
----- 

  - Move test for interval outside the analyzer class

  - Develop base classes and file formats to help standardize
    analyzers into recognizable types

  - Standardize file names and formats

  - Include time step in all streaming output formats

  - Move on-the-fly output outside of Average class to allow
    more flexible output formats.

  - Develop python and matlab classes to analyze and plot the
    outputs

Analyzer Types (or base classes):
---------------------------------

T = data type
K = key or name type

Average:                 Average of a single global scalar
                         Total energy
                         Total kinetic energy
                         Total pressure
AverageArray             container of averages, accessible by int id
AverageMap<K>            container of averages, accessible by id or key
                         Energy components (map numbers to keys)
                         Pressure components (map numbers to keys)
                         StructureFactor
AverageMatrix:           container of averages, accessible by id pair
                         PairEnergyAverage
AverageEnsemble:         RadiusGyration
TensorAverage:           Stress
TensorAverageMap<Key>:   Stress components

AutoCorr<T>:             StressAutoCorr
MsdEnsmeble<T>:          AtomMsd, MoleculeComMsd
AutoCorrEnsemble<T>:     IntraPairAutoCorr
                         IntraBondTensorAutoCorr
AutoCorrArray:        
AutoCorrMap<Key>:        VanHove functions (mapped by Miller indices)

Distribution:            Box size distribution
DistributionArray:       list of distributions
DistributionMap<Key>:    list of distributions, accessible by name
DistributionArray:       Bond distribution (multiple types)
DistributionMap<K>:      Bond distribution (multiple types)

File Types:
-----------

Each analyzer may produce several files of different types, with the same base name
but different extensions:

  - Parameter files: A parameter file, with extension *.prm, reproduces the parameter
    file block associated with an analyzer.

  - Data files: A data file, with extension *.dat contains a sequence of values,
    along with corresponding time step stamps

  - Format files: A format file, with extension *.fmt, gives names for the comments
    in the associated *.dat file

  - An average file contains final average values, with error estimates, for one
    or more quantities.

  - An average-error file, with extension type *.aer, contains further information 
    about hierarchical error analysis of averages

Data Files:
-----------

  Data file is a multicolumn text file format for a time sequence of data. The first
  column contains a time step identifier. Any number of subsequent columns may follow,
  separated by spaces. 


Average Files:
--------------

  An average file contains average values for one or more quantities. Each quantity
  is on a line of the form:

  [variable name] = [average] +- [error]


Format Files
------------

   A format file gives names for the columns in a corresponding data file.
   The first line gives the number of columns
   The next gives a list of column names, the first of which must be "iStep".
   For example, for a analyzer that analyzes all the components of energy, this
   might be:

   5
   iStep  pair  bond  kinetic  total
