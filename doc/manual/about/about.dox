Simpatico is a library of C++ classes and programs for Monte Carlo (MC), molecular dynamics (MD), and hybrid MC simulations of molecular and polymer liquids.  It has thus far been used to simulation coarse-grained bead-spring models of polymer liquids, but is adaptable to a wider range of problems. It contains the following main programs:

- Programs for MC and MD simulations on a single processor.

- A program for parallel MD simulations, using a domain decomposition algorithm.

The single-processor MC and MD programs are named mcSim and mdSim, respectively. These program can also execute multi-processor replica exchange simulations, in which each processor simulates a different system.  The parallel MD program is called ddSim.
