\subsection install_configure_scope Scope conventions

The names of the makefile variables associated with different compile time options, such as UTIL_DEBUG, contain suffixes that identify which namespaces they may appear in or affect. 
The source code for simpatico simulation programs is divided into four namespaces named Util, Simp, McMd and DdMd. 
Classes in these namespaces are located in corresponding directories src/util, src/simp, src/mcMd, and src/ddMd, respectively. 
Some of these namespaces depend on others: A namespace A is said to depend upon a second namespace B if some code in the namespace A uses classes or other names defined in the namespace B. 
There is a strict hierarchy of dependencies among namespaces: The Util namespace does not depend on any other namespace. 
The Simp namespace depends only upon Util. 
The McMd and DdMd namespaces each depend on Util and Simp, but not on each other. 

The names of makefile variables that are used to enable optional features all have prefixes UTIL_, SIMP_, MCMD_ or DDMD_ that reflect their scope, using the same conventions as those used for dependencies among source code files in different namespaces. 
Preprocessor macros whose names begin with DDMD_, which are defined in src/dMd/config.mk, only appear in the DdMd namespace (the src/ddMd directory).  
Preprocessor macros whose names begin with MCMD_, which are defined in /src/mcMd/config.mk, only appear in the source code of the McMd namespace. 
Macros with names that begin with SIMP_ are defined in simp/config.mk, and may appear or be included in the source code of the Simp, McMd and DdMd namespaces (the src/simp/, src/mcMd/, and src/dMd/ directories), but not in the Util namespace (the src/util directory). 
Macros with names that begin with UTIL_ are global: They can appear or be included in the source code in any namespace.
