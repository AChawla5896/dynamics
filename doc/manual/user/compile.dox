/*! \page user_compile_page 2.1 Compilation

\ref user_usage_page (Next) 
<BR>

Simpatico is distributed only as source code, and must be compiled by the user. All source code is written in ANSI 1998 standard C++. It has been developed and tested using the gcc and intel compilers in a linux environment, and with the gcc compiler in Mac OS X.  It should compile with any modern, standard compliant C++ compiler.   

The single-processor programs mcSim and mdSim have no external dependencies.  The ddSim program requires a Message Passing Interface (MPI) library to run on multiple processors. An MPI library is also required to compile multiprocessor versions of mcSim and mdSim, for parallel simulations in which different systems run on different processors. 

The build system uses unix makefiles. The code was developed using gnu version of make (gmake), which is available on any modern unix-like (linux or Mac OS) operating system.

\section compile_getcode_section Getting the Source Code

The source files for Simpatico may be obtained either by downloading a distribution from the program <a href=http://dmorse.github.com/simpatico/index.html>home page</a> or by using git to clone the public <a href=https://github.com/dmorse/simpatico>git repository</a>. Both the repository and the download page are hosted on <a href=http://github.com>github</a>.

To clone the git repository, after installing a git client on your home machine, enter:
\code
> git clone git://github.com/dmorse/simpatico.git
\endcode
This should create a copy of the repository in a new subdirectory named simpatico.

If you download a compressed tar file from the download page, extracting the tar file (tar -xvf tarball) will install the source files in a directory named dmorse-simpatico-ID/, where "ID" represents a hexadecimal identifier for the most recent commit in the git repository. We recommend that you immediately rename this directory simpatico/, which is the name of the corresponding directory in a git working tree. 

Throughout this documentation, we assume that the root directory of the simpatico directory tree is named simpatico/.  References to paths in this directory tree that do not start explicitly with "simpatico/" should be understood to be relative paths, relative to this root directory. All header (*.h) and source (*.cpp) files for simpatico are are in the src/ subdirectory. By default, executable files are installed in the bin/ subdirectory. The contents of the other top-level subdirectories is explained \ref source_directory_page "here".

The source code does not contain a copy of the html documentation. If desired, you may generate a local copy of the documentation with the <a href=http://www.doxygen.org>Doxygen</a> utility, by following instructions given \ref compile_doc_section "here".

\section compile_setup_section Setup script
Before the first time you compile any of the programs, you must run a bash script named "setup". This script is located in the root simpatico/ directory, and must be run from within this directory. Thus, if you start from the directory that contain the simpatico/ root directory, you must enter:
\code
> cd simpatico
> ./setup
\endcode
The period and backslash in "./setup" are required to unambiguously specify the location of the script (in the current directory).

The setup script creates initial versions of several configuration files that are required for compilation, but that users may need to modify. These configuration files are discussed below (\ref compile_config_section).  The setup script should only need to be invoked once, before the first time you compile any source code. After running the setup script, further changes to the system configuration can be made using a separate "configure" script, as discussed \ref compile_configure_section "below".

After running the setup script, inspect the file src/compiler.mk, which is a makefile fragment that is created by the setup script. The value of the makefile variable ROOT_DIR should be set to the absolute path to the simpatico/ root directory on your machine. (If this variable is not set correctly, nothing else will work). If you move the simpatico/ root directory after running "setup", you will need to either manually edit this makefile variable, or rerun the setup script.

\section compile_mcMd_section Compiling mcSim and mdSim (Single-processor versions)

To compile single-processor versions of the mcSim and mdSim programs, using the default gcc compiler, with a default set of features enabled, you must first run the setup script (see above), and then enter:
\code
> make mcMd
\endcode
from either the root simpatico/ directory or the simpatico/src directory.

If successful, this procedure should create executables bin/mcSim and bin/mdSim for MC and MD simulations. The "make mcMd" command will first compile all of the *.cpp source files in the src/util, src/inter, and src/mcMd directories, and create three static library files that contain the resulting objects.  Each *.cpp source file is compiled to create a *.o object. Each object file that is placed in the same directory as the corresponding source file. The command will also create three static library (*.a) files named libutil.a, libinter.a and libmcmd.a and (by default) place them in the simpatico lib/ directory. These libraries contain all of the objects from the util/, inter/, and mcMd/ directories, respectively. The mcSim and mdSim executables are then created by compiling the main programs src/mcMd/mcSim.cpp and src/mcMd/mdSim.cpp and linking to these three libraries. 

Users may change the locations in which the executable and library files ar installed. The directory in which all executables files are placed is given by the makefile variable BIN_DIR defined in the file src/compiler.mk, which is set to $(ROOT_DIR)/bin by default.  The directory in which static libraries are installed is given by the variable LIB_DIR, which is also defined in src/compiler.mk, and is set to $(ROOT_DIR)/lib by default.  The names of the MC and MD single-processor executables (mcSim and mdSim, by default) are given by the values of the variables MCSIM_EXE and MDSIM_EXE defined in src/mcMd/defines.mk. The resultng executable files are entirely self-contained, and may thus also be renamed or moved after they are created.

To make the executables accessible from the command line (without requiring that users invoke by typing an absolute path), users should either add the directory that contains these files to their unix PATH environment variable, or install all executable files in a directory that is already in their PATH.
  
To remove all of the object files, libraries, and executable files created by "make mcMd", one must enter "make clean-mcMd" from the src/ directory. Entering "make clean" removes all of these files, as well as any created by the "make ddMd" command (discussed below). Entering "make very-clean" removes all automatically generated files, including those removed by "make "clean" and the configuration files that were generated by the setup script.

\section compile_configure_section Configure Script
The above instructions are sufficient to compile the default version of the program, using a default set of features, with the default compiler (the gnu compiler, gcc). The root directory contains a script named "configure" that can be used to change the choice of compiler and/or the choice of optional features before compiling or recompiling. Unlike the setup script, the configure script can be run repeatedly in order to create different versions of each programs, in which different features are enabled. The configure script, like the setup script, must be run from the root simpatico/ directory. The configure script works by editing makefile fragments, all of which can also be edited manually.

As an introduction to the ./configure script, cd to the root directory, and invoke this script with a -q ("query") option, by entering
\code
   > ./configure -q
\endcode
The -q option causes the script to print a list of which features are currently enabled, and what compiler is being used. Initially, it should produce an output that looks like this:
\code
-m OFF - MPI
-g OFF - debugging
-a OFF - angle potential
-d OFF - dihedral potential
-e OFF - external potential
-l OFF - links (mutable bonds)
-k OFF - automatic dependency tracking
COMPILER:=gcc
\endcode
Every line except the last shows whether an optional compile-time feature is enabled (ON) or disabled (OFF). By default, all of the optional features are OFF.  The last line gives an identifier for the current compiler (gcc, by default). 

Each of the lines in this output that is associated with an optional feature begins with the command line option (a dash followed by a letter) that can be used to enable or disable that feature. For example, debugging is enanbled or disabled using the "-g" option. A feature is enabled by invoking configure using the associated option followed by a "1", or disabled by invoking the option followed by a "0". Thus, for example, to enable debugging (which compile in additional run-time logic and data consistency checks that are useful during development), you would invoke
\code 
> ./configure -g1
\endcode
All of the available user options are discussed in more detail \ref user_options_page "here". Whenever an optional feature is enabled, the makefile system adds a suffix to the name of the resulting executable or executables to indicate which features are enabled in that executable file. We recommend that you read the page \ref user_options_page before using the configure script to manually enable any optional features.

\section compile_compiler_section Choosing a compiler or compiler options
The default configuration created by the setup script uses gnu gcc compiler. It is also possible to choose a different compiler, and to change the options passed to the compiler.  

The file src/compiler.mk defines a string variable COMPILER, whose value is a label for one of several different compilers. By default, COMPILER=gcc, which selects the gnu compiler. The repository version of this file also contains settings appropriate for the intel compiler, which may be selected by setting COMPILER=intel.

To choose a different compiler, one may reset the value of the COMPILER string either by directly editing the src/compiler.mk file , or by using the -c option of configure script. The -c option takes the desired value of the COMPILER string as an argument. To choose the intel C++ compiler, on could thus cd to the root directory and then enter:
\code
  ./configure -c intel
\endcode
Each allowed values of the COMPILER string selects a block in the compiler.mk file that contains appropriate compiler settings for use with a particular compiler. The user is free to modify any of these settings, as needed, or to add other blocks that can be selected with other values of the COMPILER variable. 

The file src/compiler.mk file can be modified by the user as needed. The setup script creates an initial version of this file is created by copying a file named src/compiler.mk_r, which contains the default version that is stored in the repository. As a user, you may thus modify src/compiler.mk, but should generally not modify src/compiler.mk_r.

\section compile_mpi_section Enabling MPI 
The ddSim program and the multi-processor versions of mcSim and mdSim all require an MPI library for parallelization. 

For MPI to work correctly, you may need to edit the makefile variables in the file src/compiler.mk that specify the options passed to the compiler. The makefile variable MPI_LIB is an identifier that can be used to choose from among different sets of compiler settings that, for each choice of compiler, allow use with different MPI library implementations.

The default value of MPI_LIB for use with either the gcc or intel compiler is MPI_LIB=mpicxx. This value selects settings designed for use with systems that use linux kernel modules. Kernel modules allow the choice of compiler and mpi library to be chosen by loading appropriate modules before attempting to compile. This system is used on the machines of the University of Minnesota Supercomputing Institute that were used for development. The kernel module system normally provides a wrapper script named "mpcixx" to invoke the compiler that was chosen by loading a module, and to link to the chosen MPI implementation. With either the gcc or intel compiler, setting MPI_LIB=mpicxx selects settings in which CXX=mpicxx, thus invoking the compiler via this script wrapper, and sets values of CXXFLAGS and LDFLAGS appropriate for the specified compiler.

The compiler options obtained setting COMPILER=gcc and MPI_LIB=openmpi are those which we used to compile simpatico on a multi-core Mac laptop, after compiling the <a http::/www.open-mpi.org>openmpi</a> library from source. In this case, the required mpi header and library files were installed in subdirectories of /opt/local/include and /opt/local/bin, respectively. If you have an openmpi library installed, but the header and library files are installed in different locations, you may need to edit the CXXFLAGS and LDFLAGS variables to reflect the correct locations.

If none of setting in the file compiler.mk are appropriate for your machine, you will need to add a new block of makefile definitions that is enabled by a choosing a new value for the MPI_LIB and/or COMPILER identifier. If you do not use a module system, this will require that you identify the locations of the header and library files for the MPI library on your machine. If this is necessary, and you have not compiled an MPI program on a particular machine, you may need to do a bit of searching to identify the appropriate paths and/or for ask for help from a local guru.

For MPI to be enabled when a program is compiled, the makefile variable UTIL_MPI must be defined in the file src/compiler.mk. This is done automatically by the makefile targets in the simpatico/ root directory that compile the ddSim parallel program and the parallel versions of mcSim and mdSim (which are discussed below).

Developers may, however, sometimes need to manually enabled or disable MPI while modifying files in the src/ directory. This may be done by invoking
\code
  ./configure -m1
\endcode
from the root simpatico/ directory to enable, or entering "./configure -m0" to disable MPI. This should not be necessary for users who build executables by using the makefile targets in the simpatico/ or simpatico/src directories, following the instructions given below.

\section compile_ddMd_section Compiling ddSim
To compile the multi-processor ddMd program, one should check the compiler settings in the file src/compiler.mk (as discussed above) and then enter 
\code
> make ddMd
\endcode
from either the simpatico/ or simpatico/src/ directory. (The makefile in the simpatico/ directory simply invokes the makefile in the src/ directory recursively). 
  
If successful, invoking "make ddMd" will install an executable named ddSim in the simpatico/bin/ directory. To do this, the commands associated with this makefile target will:

   - Call "./configure -m1" from the root directory, to enable MPI
   - Compile mpi-enabled versions of all of the classes in the src/util/, src/inter/, and src/ddMd directories
   - Create MPI-enabled versions of the libraries containing objects from these three directories
   - Build the ddSim executable.

The resulting MPI-enabled versions of the libraries containing objects from the src/util/ and src/inter directories will be named lib/libutil_m.a lib/libinter_m.a, in which the suffix "_m" stands for mpi. The library containing objects from the ddMd/ directory will be named lib/libddMd.a. 

The parallel MD executable is named ddSim by default, and is installed in the simpatico/bin directory. The basic executable name is defined by the variable DDSIM_EXE, which is defined in the src/ddMd/defines.mk file. The executable is placed in the BIN_DIR directory.  The name and/or location of the executable may be changed by changing values of these variables before compiling, or by simply moving the executable after it is compiled. 

To clean up files created by compiling ddSim, enter
\code
> make clean-ddMd
\endcode
from the root or src directory. This will remove all files created by calling "make ddMd", including *.o object files, mpi-enabled libraries, and the ddSim executable. 

\section compile_multi_section Compiling mcSim and mdSim (multi-processor versions)
Multi-processor versions of mcSim and mdSim can be used to run:

  - Multiple completely independent simulations as an MPI job, with separate parameter files

  - Multiple simulations with a sequence of parameter values specified in a single parameter file

  - Replica exchange simulations, which also rely on the free energy perturbation theory feature

The last two applications require the use of the free energy perturbation feature, which is discussed in more 
detail \ref user_multi_McMd_page "here". The free energy perturbation feature is enabled by default when MPI is 
enabled. 

If automatic \ref dependency_doc_section "dependency generation" is not enabled, then you must enter
\code
 > make clean-McMd
\endcode
from the root or src/ directory before before compiling the multi-processor versions of mcSim and mdSim. This is necessary in order to remove object files and code that were compiled without MPI by a previous compilation of the single-processor versions mcSim and mdSim.  This step is not necessary if automatic dependency generation is enabled. 

After this, simply enter
\code
> make mcMd-mpi
\endcode
from either the simpatico/ or simpatico/src/ directory.  This should re-compile all of the classes in the src/mcMd directory, creating new mpi-enabled versions of the *.o object files, and create a corresponding mpi-enabled library named lib/libmcMd_m.a. If you have not previously compiled ddMd, or entered "make clean" before "make mcMd", this also compile MPI-enabled versions of all of the code in the src/util and src/inter directories, and create corresponding MPI-enabled static libraries named (by default) lib/libutil_m.a and lib/libinter_m.a.
 
\section dependency_doc_section Automatic Dependency Generation 

The simpatico makefile system can automatically generate and update files that list the dependencies of each *.o object file target. This feature is disabled by default, but may be enabled by following instructions given below.  Automatic dependency generation is not needed in order compile the code. It is disabled by default in order to allow new users to easily compile the single processor versions of mcSim and mdSim, using the simple instructions given above (i.e., cd simpatico; ./setup; make mcMd"). It is, however, essential for developers who make frequent changes to a few C++ header or source files, because it allows them to automatically recompile only those source files that are affected by each change.  Until this feature is enabled, the only safe way to recompile the code after changing any C++ file or configuration file is to do a clean rebuild, by entering "make clean-mcMd" or "make clean-ddMd" before recompiling.

The system for automatic dependency generation relies on both the gnu g++ compiler (which does actual analysis of dependencies) and several python scripts. To function, this system requires that:
 
  - The g++ compiler executable (or a link with this name) must exist in the shell command search PATH.

  - A python interpreter must be accessible.

  - The simpatico/tools/python/ directory must be in the shell variable PYTHONPATH, which is the python module search path. 

  - The makefile variable MAKEDEP must be defined in the file src/compiler.mk. (The definition is commented out by default).

The gcc compiler and a python interpreter are installed by default on all modern linux installations, and on Mac OS X with developer and command line tools installed.  The definition of MAKEDEP may be uncommented by invoking the -k option of the ./configure script. To enable automatic dependency generation, after running the setup script, one must:

  - Add the simpatico tools/python directory to the shell  PYTHONPATH variable, and

  - Invoke
\code
 >  ./configure -k1
\endcode
from the simpatico/ root directory. 

After making these changes, enter "make clean" once more from the src/ directory, and then follow the above instructions for compilation. When dependency generation is enabled, a new file with a suffix *.d will be created alongside each *.o object file when the corresponding source file is compiled. 

Automatic dependency generation works by applying the script bin/makeDep to each *.cpp source file whenever that file is compiled. This behavior is dictated by the pattern rules defined in the patterns.mk files in the src/util/, src/inter/, src/mcMd/, and src/ddMd/ directories.  Whenever a *.cpp file is compiled, the makeDep script generates a corresponding *.d file with the same base name.  Each *.d dependency file defines a makefile rule for the corresponding *.o object makefile file target. This rule contains a list of all the files upon which that object file depends.  This dependency list contains the associated *.cpp file and all of the *.h header files that this source file includes, including header files that are included indirectly.  Once such a dependency file exists, the makefile target it defines will be used the next time "make" is invoked in order to determine if the corresponding object file needs to be recreated as a result of changes in any of its dependencies. 

The dependency list for every *.o file contains the files src/compiler.mk and one or more of the defines.mk files, in addition to C++ source and header files.  This is because these makefile fragments contain definitions of compiler options and C++ preprocessor macros that can effect the object code produced by compilation. Modifying any of these makefile fragments will thus force recompilation of a large number of C++ source files. Modifying src/compiler.mk or src/util/defines.mk forces recompilation of every source file in simpatico.  Modifying src/util/defines.mk force recompilation of all of the source files in src/inter, src/mcMd, and src/ddMd.  Modifying src/mcMd/defines.mk forces recompilation of all files in src/mcMd.  Modifying src/ddMd/defines.mk forces recompilation of all files in src/ddMd.

\section compile_config_section Configuration Files

After the ./setup script is run, the src/ directory and its subdirectories contain several configuration files that define makefile variables whose values can be modified to control various aspects of compilation.  These configuration files are:
 
    - src/compiler.mk

    - src/util/defines.mk

    - src/inter/defines.mk

    - src/mcMd/defines.mk

    - src/ddMd/defines.mk

None of these user configable files are in the git repository, or in the version of the code that is distributed as a tar archive.  Initial versions of each of these files are instead created by the setup script by making copies of default (repository) versions of each file.  The repository version of each such file is a file with the same name as the configurable version plus a suffix "_r" (for repository), in the same directory as the configurable version. Thus, for example, an initial version of the file src/mcMd/defines.mk is created by the setup script by copying the default version src/mcMd/defines.mk_r.  Only the configurable version of each such file is used by the build system. Users should not modify the repository versions of these files.

The most common modifications of these configuration files can be carried out using the configure script, rather than directly editing configuration files.

Contents of the configuration files:

The file src/compiler.mk defines makefile variables that specify the choice of C++ compiler and compiler options, as discussed above. It defines variables ROOT_DIR, SRC_DIR, BIN_DIR, and LIB_DIR that represent the paths to the simpatico root directory and source directory, and the directories in which executables and libraries should be installed.  This file also contain a line that defines the variable MAKEDEP that is commented out by default, but which may be uncommented to enable automatic dependency generation (see \ref dependency_doc_section). It also contains a definition of a variable UTIL_MPI that can be used to enabled MPI (when UTIL_MPI=1) or to disable MPI (when the definition is commented out).

The makefile fragments src/util/defines.mk, src/inter/defines.mk, mcMd/defines.mk, and ddMd/defines.mk can be used to define makefile variables that enable or disable optional features of the code at compile time. Each of these files contains one or more commented out definitions for makefile variables that, when uncommented, cause corresponding C++ macros to be defined during compilation, and thus enable optional various features during compilation. These optional features are discussed in detail \ref user_options_page "here". 

The setup script also creates default versions of several C++ files.  The files that are creatd by the setup script are files that users might need to modify in order to customize or extend some aspect of the simulation. Each of these files is created by copying a default version whose name is obtained by adding a suffix _r to the name of the user version.  

IMPORTANT: Because the setup script actually copies some C++ files that users may subsequently modify, users should NOT call the setup script again after modifying any of these files. Doing so would cause their changes to each of these files to be overwritten by the default repository file version. 

\section compile_doc_section Documentation
The html documentation you are reading was generated using the <a href=http://www.doxygen.org> doxygen </a> documentation utility.  If dOxygen is installed on your machine, you can regenerate all of the html documentation by changing the working directory to the doc/ directory and entering 
\code
> make html 
\endcode
from within the doc/ directory. The resulting html documentation is deposited in the doc/html/ directory. To read the main page of the documentation, open the file doc/html/index.html in a browser. One may also open any other html file in this directory and follow the link to the main page. 

The text of the page you are reading now, along with others that are not extracted from C++ files, is in a set of files in the doc/dox directory. These are written in plain text, and can also be read with any text editor.  Documentation for each C++ class is extracted by doxygen from documentation blocks in the class header file. 

Entering 
\code
> make clean
\endcode
from the doc/ directory will remove all the html documentation in the doc/html directory.
