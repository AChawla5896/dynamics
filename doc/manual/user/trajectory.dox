\section user_analysis_trajectory_writer_sec Trajectory files

The ddSim program provides analyzer classes that can write a sequence of configurations as frames within a single "trajectory" file. See the list of run-time features for ddSim for a list of classes that can write different file formats.
 
\section user_analysis_config_writer_section Configuration files

The McMd::WriteConfig (for mcSim and mdSim simulations) and DdMd::WriteConfig (for ddMd simulations) classes are analyzer classes that write system configurations to file at a specified interval, for later post-processing. These classes write each configuration to a separate file. The name of each file is constructed by concatenating the outputPrefix, a base name that is specified in the parameter file block for the DumpConfig or WriteConfig class, and a sequential integer counter that is incremented by 1 after each file is written.  

The WriteConfig classes in the McMd and DdMd can each output configuration files in any of several file formats. The choice of configuration file format is a mutable property of a simulation that is initialized to a default format, which is different for different programs, and that can be reset in the command file. Each configuration file format is implemented by a subclass of McMd::ConfigIo (for mcSim or mdSim) or DdMd::ConfigIo (for ddSim). The choice of format may be reset within the command file by a SET_CONFIG_IO command with the appropriate ConfigIo subclass name as an argument. The format specified by a SET_CONFIG_IO command applies to all subsequent commands that read or write configuration files until it is reset by another SET_CONFIG_IO. Specifically, it specifies the format used by the READ_CONFIG command to read an initial configuration, by the SIMULATE command to write a sequence output files, or by the WRITE_CONFIG command to write a final output configuration after a simulation.
