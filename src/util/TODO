Boundary classes
----------------

- Add applyShift(Vector& r, IntVector &t) to boundary classes.

- Add minimumDeformRatio method to Boundary classes.

- Add bool isOrthorhombic() method to Boundary classes.
  Use to test other classes that call Boundary::lengths().

ParamComponent Classes
----------------------

- Add ability to have optional Parameters and ParamComposite.
  To do this:

  * Add buffer to Label class, and method to read label for optional element
  * Make sure ParamComposite and Parameter labels are read by Label class.
  * Add new methods to ParamComposite to attempt to read optional elements.

  -> Work in branch

Serialization
-------------

- Create ability to do true binary serialization, without single restart 
  file for each processor. Required changes in Util namespace:

  * Create serialize methods for pointer containers that allocate data, but 
    that do not copy pointers. 

  - Create serialize methods for Managers that save the names, and that
    use the factory to reconstruct associated objects during loading.

  - Create binary serialize methods for all objects created by factories.
    Base class methods should just throw exceptions.

  Further changes to McMd namespace are discussed there.

  - Create serialization method (serialize or save and load) for Simulation
    that initialize all pointers after allocating all arrays. 

  - Make sure that loading methods explicitly create required associations 
    between child objects.
