FileMaster
----------

- Allow opening of all files with arbitrary modes

- Provide methods that just provide paths, so that users can
  open files separately, if desired.

- Clean up repetitive code by providing generic methods to
  open input and output files with error checking, then use
  generic open and path functions inside more specialized
  methods.

Boundary classes - non-orthogonal
---------------------------------

- Add applyShift(Vector& r, IntVector &t) to boundary classes.

- Add minimumDeformRatio method to Boundary classes.

- Add bool isOrthogonal() method to Boundary classes. Use to test other 
  classes that call Boundary::lengths().

Boundary classes - deformation
------------------------------

- Add typedef Vector Deformation;

- Add void deform(Deformation& deformation) method.

- Add DEFORM command to ddSim command script.
