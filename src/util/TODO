Boundary classes
----------------

- Add applyShift(Vector& r, IntVector &t) to boundary classes.

- Add minimumDeformRatio method to Boundary classes.

- Add bool isOrthogonal() method to Boundary classes. Use to 
  test other classes that call Boundary::lengths().

ParamComponent Classes
----------------------

- Add ability to have optional Parameters and ParamComposite.
  To do this:

  * Add buffer to Label class, and method to read label for optional element
  * Make sure ParamComposite and Parameter labels are all read by Label class.
  * Add new methods to ParamComposite to attempt to read optional elements, or
    add a bool flag object to indicate that the element is optional.

-> Work in branch

Serialization
-------------

Create ability to do true binary serialization, with single restart file for 
each system. Required changes in Util namespace:

  - Create serialize methods for pointer containers. These should allocate data, 
    but not copy pointers. 

  - Create serialize methods for Manager template that save the class names, and 
    that uses the factory to reconstruct associated objects during loading. After
    instantiation, the serialize method should be called for each such object.

  - Create serialize methods for all base classes defined in Util (e.g., ParamComposite). 
    These must be called explicitly in subclass serialize methods.

  Further changes to McMd namespace are discussed there. These include:

  - Create serialize methods for all objects created by factories. Base class 
    methods should just throw exceptions.

  - Make sure that loading methods explicitly allocate all required memory, and 
    create required associations between child objects.

  - Create serialization method (serialize or save and load) for Simulation that 
    initialize all pointers after allocating all arrays.
