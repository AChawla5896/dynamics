The classes in subdirectories of src/util provide general utilities for 
scientific programming in C++.

Subdirectories:
----------------------

util           Exception, Log, FileMaster and other general utility classes
format         classes for formatted output of primitive types in ostreams
containers     container template classes and associated iterators
mpi            utility classes for MPI programming
param          classes for parameter file input and output
math           mathematical constants and operations.
space          classes to describe Cartesian vectors, tensors, and grids. 
boundary       classes to define periodic boundary conditions.
crystal        classes related to crystallographic symmetry
ensembles      classes that define statistical mechanical ensembles
archives       serialization classes (compatible with Boost serialization)
random         random number generators and processes.
accumulators   statistical accumulator classes.

Makefile targets 
----------------

The makefile in src/util may be used to compile the classes in src/util.

make all       make all *.o files in src/util
make clean     remove all *.o files in src/util
