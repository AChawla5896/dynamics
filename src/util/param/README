This directory contains three classes that are used to handle input and 
output of parameters required by other classes.  Classes that require 
file I/O of parameters are all derived from ParamComposite.  See the 
documentation for ParamComposite for usage.

ParamComponent is an abstract base class. Classes ParamComposite, Parameter,
Begin, End, and Blank are derived directly from ParamComponent. Classes 
ScalarParam, CArrayParam, DArrayParam, and CArray2DParam are subclasses of 
Parameter.
