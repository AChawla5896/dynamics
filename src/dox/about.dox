/*! \page about_page About Simpatico

Simpatico is a library of C++ classes and programs for Monte 
Carlo and molecular dynamics simulations of molecular and
polymer liquids. It contains the following main programs:

- Closely related programs for Monte Carlo (MC) and molecular 
  dynamics (MD) simulations on a single processor.

- A program for parallel MD simulations, using a domain
  decomposition algorithm.

The single-processor MC and MD programs are named mcSim and mdSim, 
respectively. These programs can also execute replica exchange
simulations in which each of processors simulates a different 
replica of the system.  The parallel domain decomposition MD 
program, is called ddSim.  ddSim is a recent addition to the 
package, and is less mature than that the other two programs. 
Simpatico is distributed under the terms of the GNU public 
license (see the LICENSE file). 

The design of Simpatico was motivated by the following goals: 

- Extensibility: All programs are designed to allow new 
  algorithms to be added for most elements of a simulation, 
  via C++ inheritance, without modifying the core source code. 
  Extensible elements of a simulation include Monte Carlo moves, 
  molecular dynamics integrators, potential energy functions, 
  molecular species, data analysis algorithms, and configuration 
  file formats.

- Efficiency: Simpatico is designed to be competitive as a tool 
  for computationally demanding research projects. 

- Integrating Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics:
  The single-processor programs mcSim and mdSim provide efficient 
  implementations of standard MC and MD simulation algorithms, 
  based on a shared code base. They are thus particularly suitable
  for hybrid Monte Carlo (HMC) algorithms, in which short MD 
  simulations are used as proposed Monte Carlo moves. Simpatico 
  also provides an optional module that allows the HOOMD-blue 
  code for MD on graphical processing units (GPUs) to be used 
  as an engine for very fast hybrid MC simulations, in a way
  that allows the GPU-accelerated HMC move to be combined with 
  other MC moves.

- Integrated data analysis: mcSim and mdSim come bundled with 
  a set of data analysis classes that can all be used either 
  "on-the-fly", during a simulation, or for post-processing.
  Postprocessing is done by using the same two programs to 
  read in system trajectories that were written to file by an
  earlier simulation. 

The design of mcSim and mdSim (which are very similar) is similar 
in many ways to that of 
<a href=http://www.etomica.org>Etomica</a>, 
which was written in Java by David Kofke's group at the University 
of Buffalo.  
The domain decomposition algorithm used in ddSim is similar to
that used in LAMMPS.

Simpatico is a young project, and lacks some features found in 
any of several more mature molecular dynamics packages, such as 
Lammps, NAMD, Gromacs, and Espresso, and in a smaller number of
MC packages, such as Towhee. It has thus far been used only for
simulations of coarse-grained models of polymer liquids.
