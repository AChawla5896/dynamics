/*! \page about_page About Simpatico

Simpatico is a library of C++ classes and programs for Monte 
Carlo and molecular dynamics simulations of molecular and polymer 
liquids. It contains the following main components:

- Two closely related programs for Monte Carlo (MC) and molecular 
  dynamics (MD) simulations on a single processor.

- A program for parallel MD simulations, in which a domain
  decomposition algorithm is used to divide a single system 
  among multiple processors.

The single-processor MC and MD programs are named mcSim and mdSim, 
respectively. The parallel domain decomposition MD program, which
is a very recent addition to the project, is named ddSim. The 
mcSim and mdSim programs can also execute replica exchange 
simulations and other trivially parallel simulations in which 
each of many processors simulates a different system.  Simpatico 
is distributed under the terms of the GNU public license (see the 
LICENSE file). 

Simpatico was designed with following goals in mind:

- Extensibility: All programs are designed to allow new 
  algorithms to be added for most elements of a simulation, via 
  C++ inheritance, without modifying the original source code. 
  Extensible elements of a simulation include Monte Carlo moves, 
  molecular dynamics integrators, potential energy functions, 
  molecular species, data analysis algorithms, and configuration 
  file formats.

- Efficiency: All Simpatico programs are efficient enough to be 
  competitive as tools for computationally demanding projects. 

- Integrating Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics:
  The single-processor programs mcSim and mdSim provide efficient 
  implementations of standard MC and MD simulation algorithms, 
  based on a shared code base. They are thus automatically
  suitable for hybrid Monte Carlo (HMC) algorithms, in which 
  short MD simulations are used as proposed Monte Carlo moves. 
  Simpatico also provides an optional module that allows 
  the HOOMD-blue 
  code for MD on graphical processing units (GPUs) to be used 
  as an engine for very fast hybrid MC simulations, in a way
  that allows the GPU-accelerated HMC move to be combined 
  with other MC moves.

- Integrated data analysis and simulation: All data analysis 
  classes for mcSim and mdSim can be used either "on-the-fly", 
  to sample the state of a system at periodic intervals during 
  a simulation, or for post-processing, by using either of these 
  two programs to read in a sequence of system configurations 
  written to file during a previous simulation. These 
  single-processor programs can also be used to analyze 
  trajectories generated by the parallel ddSim program, or by 
  other programs.

The design of mcSim and mdSim (which are very similar) is similar 
in many ways to that of 
<a href=http://www.etomica.org>Etomica</a>, 
which was written in Java by David Kofke's group at the University 
of Buffalo.  
The domain decomposition algorithm used in ddSim closely resembles 
that used in early versions of LAMMPS.

Simpatico is a young project, and lacks some features found in 
any of several more mature molecular dynamics packages, such as 
Lammps, NAMD, Gromacs, and Espresso, and in a smaller number of
MC packages, such as Towhee. 
The mcSim and mdSim programs have thus far been used primarily 
for simulations of coarse-grained bead spring models of polymer 
liquids. The ddSim parallel MD code is much newer (March 2012), 
and still lacks many features.
