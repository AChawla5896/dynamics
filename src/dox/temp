\section boundary_sec Boundary

A \ref Util::Boundary object defines periodic boundary conditions for 
a simulation. A Boundary contains the dimensions of periodic simulation 
unit cell, and provides methods to calculate separation vectors and 
distances using the nearest image convention, and to shift a position 
Util::Vector into the primary unit cell.

In the current implementation, the name Util::Boundary is a typedef for
the class Util::OrthorhombicBoundary. The use of a typedef is intended 
to make it easier to later develop versions of the code with more 
general boundaries (e.g., non-orthogonal axes). 

\section ensemble_sec Statistical Ensembles

EnergyEnsemble, BoundaryEnsemble, and SpeciesEnsemble are simple
classes that specify the statistical ensemble to be used to sample
fluctuations in energy, boundary volume and/or shape, and number of 
molecules of each species, respectively.  Each such ensemble has a 
type, to specify whether the associated macroscopic variable is 
constrained or has a Boltzmann weight, and can also store for an 
intensive parameter or parameters required to define the Boltzmann 
weight. For example, the EnergyEnsemble type can be "adiabatic" or 
"isothermal", and stores a value of the temperature if the type is
isothermal.  Each System has one associated EnergyEnsemble object 
and one associated BoundaryEnsemble object. Each Species object 
will have [not yet implemented] one associated SpeciesEnsemble 
object.
