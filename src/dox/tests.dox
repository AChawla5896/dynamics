/*! \page test_page Unit Tests

The src/test/ directory contain source code for a simple unit test framework.
This framework can be used to test MPI parallel programs as well as single
processor classes and programs.  Documentation for the test framework, 
including examples, is in the the src/test/ directory. 

The unit test class for each class (if any) is generally located in a 
subdirectory named "tests/" of the directory containing the class header 
and source files. Unit tests are not compiled by the makefile system that 
is used to compile the classes needed for simulation. Tests may be compiled
separately by invoking "make all" from any tests/ directory. This generally
creates an executable named "Test" that runs all of the tests in one test
directory.
