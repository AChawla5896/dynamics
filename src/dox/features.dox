Simpatico is not yet a mature simulation package, but aspires to 
become one. The core of Simpatico was developed by rewriting a 
package named PMC that is used in our group for NVT simulations 
of coarse-grained bead-spring models of flexible polymer liquids. 
Thus far, both packages provide only those features that we
have needed for these simulations.
