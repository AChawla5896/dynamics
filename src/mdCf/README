The directory tree rooted at src/mdCf contains all source and header 
files for all classes in the MdCf namespace. These are designed for 
single-processor analysis of MD configurations, and are intended to 
be used for analysis of trajectories produced by the parallel ddSim 
molecular dynamics program.

Subdirectories:
---------------

chemistry      atoms, covalent groups (bonds, etc.), molecules and species
storage        containers for atoms and groups. System represent a configuration
analyzers      data analysis (classes derived from Analyzer)
configIos      configuration file IO 
processor      a master class for analysis of trajectories
user           space for user-provided classes
tests          unit tests

Makefile targets 
----------------

The src/mdCf directory contains a makefile that can be used to execute 
in-source compilation of all of the classes in the directory tree rooted 
at mdCf, and build a corresponding static library. The most important 
targets are:

make all      make all *.o files in src/mdCf and its subdirectories, build
              a static library mdCf<suffix>.a in lib/, and install two
              executables named mdSim<suffix> and mcSim<suffix> in bin/.

make clean    remove all *.o files in src/mdCf and its subdirectories and
              the static library file.

Corresponding makefiles in the src/mdCf subdirectory of obj/serial or
obj/parallel can be used for out-of-source builds. Because it does not
use MPI, by convention, the MdCf namespace code is built in obj/serial.
