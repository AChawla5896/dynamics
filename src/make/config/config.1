# file: $(BLD_DIR)/config.mk
#
# This config.mk file is a makefile fragment, which is the main configuration 
# file for the makefile-based build system.  A copy of this file is included 
# by all other makefiles.  A copy of this file is created in the src/
# directory (which is used for in source compilation) and in the root of 
# the bld/parallel and bld/serial build directories (for out of source
# compilation). These files are created by invoking the "setup" script from
# the root simpatico directory, and do not exist before this script is run.
#
#=========================================================================
# Summary of contents:
#
# This file contains definitions of makefile variables that specify:
# 
#  - Absolute paths for the simpatico directory and some subdirectories
#  - A variable UTIL_DEBUG that, if defined, enables debugging checks
#  - A variable UTIL_MPI that, if defined, enables MPI
#  - A variable UTIL_CXX11 that, if defined, enables use of C++11
#  - Several variables that define compiler commands, options and flags 
#  - A variable MAKEDEP that enables automatic dependency generation
#
# After setup, common changes to this file may be made either by editing
# the file or by invoking the "configure" script from the build directory 
# that contains this config.mk file with appropriate options.  Specifically, 
# this script may be used to enable (option -m1) or disable (-m0) MPI, and
# to enable (-g1) or disable (-g1) debugging. For example, the command:
#
# ./configure -m1 -g0 
#
# would enable MPI and disable debugging prior to compilation.
#
# Detailed documentation of the meaning of the variables defined in this
# file is given in the file src/make/config.README.

#======================================================================
# Variables that enable compile time options:

# Defining UTIL_DEBUG enables a variety of extra sanity checks, at some
# cost in speed. Debugging is disabled (commented out) by default.
#UTIL_DEBUG=1

# Defining UTIL_MPI enables linking to an MPI library. MPI must be
# enabled by uncommenting this line to build a parallel program.
#UTIL_MPI=1

# Defining UTIL_CXX11 enables the use of features of the C++11 standard.
# Use of C++11 is disabled (commented out) by default. If C++11 is disabled, 
# the code uses only syntax and features defined in the older 1998 C++ 
# standard.
#UTIL_CXX11=1

# Comment: Thus far, very little of the code uses features of C++11.
# Equivalent replacements from C++ 1998 are used in these few cases. 
# There is thus no harm in leaving UTIL_CXX11 undefined.
