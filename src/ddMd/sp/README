The directory tree rooted at src/ddMd/sp contains all classes for
single-processor analysis of MD configurations. These are intended to 
be used for analysis of trajectories produced by ddSim.

Subdirectories:
---------------

chemistry      atoms, covalent groups (bonds, etc.), molecules and species
storage        containers for atoms and groups. System represent a configuration
analyzers      data analysis (classes derived from Analyzer)
configIos      configuration file IO 
processor      a master class for analysis of trajectories
user           space for user-provided classes
tests          unit tests
