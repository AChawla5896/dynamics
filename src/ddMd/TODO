Configuration File IO
---------------------

- Add ConfigIo factory and SET_CONFIG_IO command.

- Add LammpsConfigIo class


Constant Pressure:
------------------

- Add vFlag and eFlag to Simulation, and as an argument to addForce() 
  method of each potential.

- Port NPH integrator.

- Write a reversible NPT integrator.


Reverse Communication
---------------------

- Write and test reverse_update() method.

- Add bool reverseCommunicate_ accessor and setter to Simulation.

- Modify potentials, Exchanger, etc. to accomodate reverseCommunicate.


Cell List and Pair List:
------------------------

- Make AtomTag struct a public class, add an IntVector
  of micro-cell indices to CellTag, to allow fast rejection
  of most pairs.

- Modify neighbors method to pass pack a list of AtomTag objects,
  rather than an array of pointers. Provide a CellList isInPair 
  method to decide if a particular pair is within the cutoff.

- Consider how neighbor list would be built if we used Newton's
  law (to evaluate each force only once).

- Improve testing of PairList - provide method to count number of pairs
  that are currently within the cutoff, and check that it doesn't change.


Buffer:
-------

- Add memory statistics for Buffer.

- Figure out how to make pack/unpack methods of the atom class, so 
  that they can use private information.


Single Processor Operation
--------------------------

- Modify Distributor, Collector, ConfigIo, and Exchanger classes
  to work ifndef UTIL_MPI, continue with other classes, to enable 
  single processor operation with no MPI.


Hybrid MD
----------

- Add lists of old positions to AtomStorage.

- Add arriving_ and departing_ pointer arrays to storage classes.

- Add methods to commit or revert the state of each storage.


Atom Class Implementation
--------------------------

- see doc/notes/ddMd/Atom file


Files
-----

- Think about separating topology and configuration files. 

Restart
-------

- Add restart capability.


Integer Types
-------------

- Introduce typedefs for integer names in global.h.

  Try uint4 for all integers except those which must be of either sign.
  Where are there integers that can have a sign, other than in IntVector?

- Make typeId and id for atoms and groups type index throughout the code. 


Testing
-------

- Test conservation of energy with dihedrals.
