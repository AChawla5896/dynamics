Clean-up
--------

- Rename implementation files *.tpp for
  Group_Distributor and Group_Collector

- Move DdMd::DdTimer to Util::Timer, use
  in both namespaces.

Performance Issue:
------------------

- Building PairList: Consider use of micro-cell indices
  in CellList to allow faster rejection during PairList.

Stress and NPT ensemble:
------------------------

- Add needStress to Simulation, and as argument to addForces() method 
  of potentials. 

- Port NPH integrator.

- Write a reversible NPT integrator.

Buffer:
------

- Add memory statistics for Buffer.

- Figure out how to make pack/unpack methods the atom 
  class, so that they can use private information.

CellList and PairList
---------------------

- Consider how neighbor list would be built if we used Newton's
  law (evaluate each force only once).

- Consider providing separate pair iterators for ghost neighbors
  and local neighbors.

- Consider introducing micro-cell indices in CellList (noted above).

Single Processor Operation
--------------------------

- Modify Distributor, Collector, ConfigIo, and Exchanger classes to 
  work ifndef UTIL_MPI, continue with other classes, to enable 
  single processor operation with no MPI.

Atom Class Implementation
--------------------------

- see doc/notes/ddMd/Atom file

Configuration File IO
--------------------------

- Add ConfigIo factory and SET_CONFIG_IO command.

- Add LammpsConfigIo class


Reverse Communication
---------------------

- Write variant with Newton's law and reverse communication.

Files
-----

- Think about separating topology and configuration files. 

Restart
-------

- Add restart capability.


Integer Types
-------------

- Introduce typedefs for integer names in global.h.

  Try uint4 for all integers except those which must be of either sign.
  Where are there integers that can have a sign, other than in IntVector?

- Make typeId and id for atoms and groups type index throughout the code. 

Testing
-------

- Test conservation of energy with dihedrals.

- Improve unit testing of CellList (add atoms and ghosts, small boxes),
  Integrator (check that number of interacting pairs doesn't change),
  System (test with very small system, 1x1x1 grid).
