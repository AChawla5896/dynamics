Testing
-------

- Fix CellTest

- Test angle and dihedral stress calculations.

Initial Ghost Exchange
----------------------

- Reduce memory requirements during initial ghost exchange.

- See doc/notes/ddMd/initGhosts

Cell List and Pair List:
------------------------

- Modify Cell::OffsetArray object to use strips of cells, to allow efficient 
  use of smaller cells.

- Modify OffsetArray to include all cells for which the closest corner is 
  within the pair list cutoff.

Flexible Unit Cells:
--------------------

- Generalize makeSnapShot and needsExchange methods in AtomStorage to
  allow for deforming boundaries (requires further changes to Boundary).

Buffer:
-------

- Allocate in bytes, remove atomCapacity and ghostCapacity 
  (see doc/notes/ddMd/Buffer)

Moving GroupStorage to Potential class:
---------------------------------------

- Move Exchanger methods to methods of GroupStorage.

- Make each GroupStorage a member of associated potential.

- Create a GroupExchanger abstract base class for GroupStorage<N>

- Add registry of GroupExchanger objects to Exchanger.

- see doc/notes/ddMd/GroupStorage

Dynamic Resizing
----------------

- Allow for dynamic resizing of PairList class during creation.

- Allow for dynamic resizing of Storage classes.
  For AtomStorage, must emit signal to reset pointers to atoms.

Hybrid MD
---------

- Finish and test transactions in AtomStorage (in transactions branch).

- Add transactions to GroupStorage (in transactions branch).

Single Processor Operation
--------------------------

- Modify Distributor, Collector, ConfigIo, and Exchanger classes to 
  work ifndef UTIL_MPI, continue with other classes, to enable single 
  processor operation with no MPI.

Atom
----

- Add speciesId, moleculeId, localId to each atom.

Files
-----

- Modify default file format to store speciesId, moleculeId, molAtomId indices.

- Think about separating topology and configuration files.
