Domain Decomposition MD (DdMd)
------------------------------

Pairs and bonds:
----------------

- Add needStress to Simulation, and as argument to addForces() method 
  of potentials. 

- Port NPH integrator.

- Add ConfigIo factory and SET_CONFIG_IO command.

- Modify Distributor, Exchanger and Exchanger classes to work ifndef 
  UTIL_MPI, continue with other classes.

- Improve unit testing of CellList (add atoms and ghosts, small boxes),
  Integrator (check that number of interacting pairs doesn't change),
  System (test with very small system, 1x1x1 grid).

External Potential:
-------------------

- Finish ExternalPotential class, and associated implementation and
  factory class. Figure out how to test this. 

- Add externalPotential() to Simulation, invoke methods to test 
  external forces and energies. 

- Test convservation of energy with external forces. 


Angles and dihedrals:
--------------------

- Add angles and dihedrals to Exchanger, test this thoroughly.

- Create AnglePotential and DihedralPotential classes, with associated
  implementation and factory classes.

- Add AnglePotential and DihedralPotential classes to Simulation.

- Add methods to (conditionally) calculate angle and dihedral forces 
  in Simulation.

- Test conservation of energy.
