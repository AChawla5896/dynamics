Domain Decomposition MD (DdMd)
------------------------------

- Modify Exchanger::exchangeAtoms to set atom plans for covalent
  ghosts. Check that this completes all bonds.

- Move potentials/PairPotential.h to potentials/PairInteraction.

- Move Interaction to potentials/PairPotential.

- Write class potentials/BondPotential.

- Incorporate bond forces into System.

- Add Collector to ConfigIo, to allow writing. 

- Add readCommands() method to System to read command file. 

- Make Integrator etc. abstract base classes.

- Add factories and clean up param file format.

- Modify Exchanger to work ifndef UTIL_MPI, continue with other classes.

- Improve unit testing of CellList (add atoms and ghosts, small boxes),
  Integrator (check that number of interacting pairs doesn't change),
  System (test with very small system, 1x1x1 grid).
