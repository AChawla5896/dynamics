------------------------------

- Modify Exchanger::exchangeAtoms to exchange bonds.

- Modify Exchanger::exchangeGhosts accordingly.

- Add bond forces to System.

- Add Collector to ConfigIo, to allow writing. 

- Modify Exchanger to work ifndef UTIL_MPI, continue with other classes.

- Improve unit testing of CellList (add atoms and ghosts, small boxes),
  Integrator (check that number of interacting pairs doesn't change),
  System (test with very small system, 1x1x1 grid).

- Make Integrator and Interaction abstract base classes.

- Move integrate(int nStep) method to Integrator class.
