Configuration File IO
--------------------------

- Add ConfigIo factory and SET_CONFIG_IO command.

- Add LammpsConfigIo class


Single Processor Operation
--------------------------

- Modify Distributor, Collector, ConfigIo, and Exchanger classes to 
  work ifndef UTIL_MPI, continue with other classes.

Restart
-------

- Add restart capability.


Files
-----

- Think about separating topology and configuration files. 


Parallelization
----------------

- Write variant with Newton's law an reverse communication.

Stress and NPT ensemble:
------------------------

- Add needStress to Simulation, and as argument to addForces() method 
  of potentials. 

- Port NPH integrator.

- Write a reversible NPT integrator.

Testing
-------

- Test conservation of energy with dihedrals.

- Improve unit testing of CellList (add atoms and ghosts, small boxes),
  Integrator (check that number of interacting pairs doesn't change),
  System (test with very small system, 1x1x1 grid).
