Instrumentation (for optimization):
-----------------------------------

- Add timing stamps to update method.

- Replace timing stamps by private inline method that do nothing
  if DDMD_EXCHANGER_TIMER is not defined.

- Add timer to time construction of pair list and cell list.

- Add memory statistics for Buffer.

CellList and PairList
---------------------

- Review design, see if better use can be made of information
  implicit in Cell List (i.e., which cells are ghost cells).

- Consider how neighbor list would be built if we used Newton's
  law (evaluate each force only once).

- Consider providing separate pair iterators for ghost neighbors
  and local neighbors.

Single Processor Operation
--------------------------

- Modify Distributor, Collector, ConfigIo, and Exchanger classes to 
  work ifndef UTIL_MPI, continue with other classes, to enable 
  single processor operation with no MPI.

Integer Types
-------------

- Introduce typedefs for integer names in global.h.

  Try uint4 for all integers except those which must be of either sign.
  Where are there integers that can have a sign, other than in IntVector?

- Make typeId and id for atoms and groups type index throughout the code. 

Atom Class Implementation
--------------------------


Configuration File IO
--------------------------

- Add ConfigIo factory and SET_CONFIG_IO command.

- Add LammpsConfigIo class

Restart
-------

- Add restart capability.


Files
-----

- Think about separating topology and configuration files. 


Parallelization
----------------

- Write variant with Newton's law an reverse communication.

Stress and NPT ensemble:
------------------------

- Add needStress to Simulation, and as argument to addForces() method 
  of potentials. 

- Port NPH integrator.

- Write a reversible NPT integrator.

Testing
-------

- Test conservation of energy with dihedrals.

- Improve unit testing of CellList (add atoms and ghosts, small boxes),
  Integrator (check that number of interacting pairs doesn't change),
  System (test with very small system, 1x1x1 grid).
