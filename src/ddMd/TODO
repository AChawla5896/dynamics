Testing
-------

- Improve testing of PairList - check that number of inner pairs doesn't
  change upon reneighboring, in unit tests and as optional test in integrator.

- Test conservation of energy with dihedrals.

Flexible Unit Cells:
--------------------

- Generalize makeSnapShot and needsExchange methods in AtomStorage to allow
  for deforming boundaries. 

Constant Pressure:
------------------

- Finish and test methods to evaluate stress.

- Add vFlag and eFlag to Simulation, and as arguments to addForce() method 
  of each potential.

- Port NPH integrator.

- Write a reversible NPT integrator.

Configuration File IO
---------------------

- Add option for ordered output of atoms.

- Add LammpsConfigIo class

Hybrid MD
----------

- Add arriving_ and departing_ pointer arrays to storage classes.

- Add lists of old atom positions to AtomStorage.

- Add methods to commit or revert the state of each storage.

Cell List and Pair List:
------------------------

- Make AtomTag struct a public class, add an IntVector of micro-cell 
  indices to CellTag, to allow fast rejection of most pairs.

- Modify Cell::getNeighbors method to pass back a list of AtomTag objects, 
  rather than an array of pointers. Provide a CellList method to decide if 
  a particular pair is within the cutoff.

Distributor and Collector
-------------------------

- Remove association with Domain, remove explicit use of domain communicator.

- Require that setup method be called on all processors, and that it take
  as a parameters a communicator, a rank for the root processor, and ranks
  begin and end for processors that represent spatial domains, which lie 
  in the range begin <= rank < end.

Buffer:
-------

- Change envelope sent with block to contain:

  sendSize_
  sendTimeSize_
  sendItemType_
  isComplete_

  For groups, add enumerations BOND, ANGLE, DIHEDRAL and
  use Type = Buffer::BOND + N - 2 in templates for Group<N>. 

- In beginSendBlock() method, add parametr itemSize and
  remove parameter groupSize.

- Make pack/unpack methods public. 

- Add public methods to endPackItem() and endUnpackItem(), to
  increment counters. These can check cursor against expected 
  position, based on itemSize and item counters.

- Check cursor against end of block in unpack method template.

- Move pack/unpack methods to methods of Atom and Group classes.

- Add memory statistics for Buffer.

- Add values INT, DOUBLE, VECTOR to enumeration of types.

Single Processor Operation
--------------------------

- Modify Distributor, Collector, ConfigIo, and Exchanger classes to work 
  ifndef UTIL_MPI, continue with other classes, to enable single processor 
  operation with no MPI.

Atom Class Implementation
--------------------------

- see doc/notes/ddMd/Atom file

Files
-----

- Think about separating topology and configuration files. 

Restart
-------

- Add restart capability.
