Domain Decomposition MD (DdMd)
------------------------------

- Add needStress to Simulation, and as argument to addForces() method 
  of potentials. 

- Port NPH integrator.

- Absorb code for bonds in ConfigIo and Exchanger into template methods, 
  to simplify addition of angles and dihedrals.

- Add ConfigIo factory and SET_CONFIG_IO command.

- Modify Distributor, Exchanger and Exchanger classes to work ifndef 
  UTIL_MPI, continue with other classes.

- Improve unit testing of CellList (add atoms and ghosts, small boxes),
  Integrator (check that number of interacting pairs doesn't change),
  System (test with very small system, 1x1x1 grid).
