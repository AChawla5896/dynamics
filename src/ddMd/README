This directory contains source code for a parallel domain-decomposition 
(DD) molecular dynamics (MD) program. All of the code in this directory
is defined in the DdMd namespace. The code uses a parallelization strategy 
similiar to that used in LAMMPS and other DD parallel MD codes. It is 
thus far only capable of simulating a system of point particles with 
non-bonded pair and bonded two-body interactions.  

The code in the DdMd namespace (or ddMd/ directory) uses classes defined 
in the Util namespace (or util/ directory), but does not use any classes 
from the McMD namespace (or mcMd/ directory).  Most files in the DdMd 
namespace contain a "using namespace Util" directive that brings the 
entire Util namespace into scope within the DdMd namespace.
