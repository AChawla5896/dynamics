This directory contains source code for a parallel domain-decomposition 
(DD) molecular dynamics (MD) program. All of the code in this directory
is defined in the DdMd namespace. The code uses a parallelization strategy 
similiar to that used in LAMMPS and several other parallel MD codes. 

The code in the DdMd namespace (or ddMd/ directory) uses classes defined 
in the Util and Inter namespaces (or the util/ and inter/ directories), 
but does not use any code from the McMD namespace (or mcMd/ directory).  
Most files in the DdMd namespace contain a "using namespace Util" directive 
that brings the entire Util namespace into scope within the DdMd namespace.
A few files that use classes from the Inter namespace also contain a
"using namespace Inter" directive.
