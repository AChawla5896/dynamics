This directory contains source code for a parallel domain-decomposition 
(DD) molecular dynamics (MD) program. All of the code in this directory
is defined in the DdMd namespace. The code uses a parallelization strategy 
similiar to that used in LAMMPS and several other parallel MD codes. 

The code in the DdMd namespace (or ddMd/ directory) uses classes defined 
in the Util namespace (or util/ directory), but does not use any classes 
from the McMD namespace (or mcMd/ directory).  Most files in the DdMd 
namespace contain a "using namespace Util" directive that brings the 
entire Util namespace into scope within the DdMd namespace.
