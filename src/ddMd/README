WARNING: EXPERIMENTAL CODE
--------------------------

This directory contains unfinished code for a domain-decomposition
(DD) parallel molecular dynamics (MD) program. The code is based on 
a parallelization strategy similiar to that used in LAMMPS and other 
DD parallel MD codes, but is thus far only capable of simulating a 
system of point particles with non-bonded pair interactions, with 
no covalent interactions. The code uses same the utility classes 
in the Util namespace (or util/ directory) as those used by the 
McMD code, but is otherwise separate.

Users of the serial MC/MD code in the McMd directory can (for now)
safely ignore this.
