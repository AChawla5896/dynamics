WARNING: EXPERIMENTAL CODE
--------------------------

This directory contains unfinished code for a domain-decomposition
(DD) parallel molecular dynamics (MD) program. The code is based on 
a parallelization strategy similiar to that used in LAMMPS and other 
DD parallel MD codes. It is thus far only capable of simulating a 
system of point particles with non-bonded pair and bonded two-body
interactions.  The code relies on utility classes defined in the 
Util namespace (or util/ directory), but does not use any code 
from the McMD namespace (or mcMd/ directory).
