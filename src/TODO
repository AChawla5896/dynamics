See util/TODO, mcMd/TODO, and ddMd/TODO for further TODO lists.
This file contains only items that are not localized to a namespace.

Makefiles
---------

- Add separate macros COMPILER_MPI and COMPILER_NO_MPI, and set COMPILER to an
  appropriate value depending on if UTIL_MPI is defined.

- Add "all" target to src/makefile that compiles ddMd code iff UTIL_MPI is defined

- Figure out how to invoke make with options

- Add python script setOptions to modify common options by editing compiler.mk and
  defines.mk files.

Tests
-----

- Figure out how to configure tests so that appropriate tests are run depending on 
  value of UTIL_MPI or TEST_MPI. Have serial tests run in either mode, parallel 
  tests only in parallel mode.

- Figure out how to automate regression tests for stream outputs, to remove
  remaining need for human inspection. Output to stringStream and compare to 
  older result in a file?

- Add a single command to master makefile that runs all tests.
