See util/TODO, mcMd/TODO, and ddMd/TODO for further TODO lists.
This file contains only items that are not localized to a namespace.

Makefiles
---------

- Add separate macros COMPILER_MPI and COMPILER_SERIAL, and set COMPILER to 
  an appropriate value depending on if UTIL_MPI is defined.

- Add python script setOptions to modify common options by editing compiler.mk 
  and defines.mk files.

Tests
-----

- Configure tests so that appropriate tests are run depending on value of 
  UTIL_MPI or TEST_MPI. Have serial tests run in either mode, parallel tests 
  only in parallel mode.

- Automate regression tests for stream and string outputs, to remove remaining 
  need for human inspection.
