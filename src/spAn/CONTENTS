The directory tree rooted at src/spAn contains classes for storage and 
analysis of MD configurations on a single processor. These are intended 
to be used for analysis of trajectories produced by ddSim, either during 
post-processing of MD trajectory files or on-the-fly, for operations that
are most easily carried out on a single processor.
