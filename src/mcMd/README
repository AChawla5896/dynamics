The directory tree rooted at src/mcMd contains all of the classes in the 
McMd namespace. 

Subdirectories:
----------------------

boundary       periodic boundary conditions and minimum image convention
potentials     classes that define potential energy functions
  pair         nonbonded pair potential classes
  bond         covalent bond potential classes (also for "links")
  angle        covalent three-body angle potential classes
  dihedral     covalent four-body angle dihedral torsion classes
  link         mutable covalent bond potentials (e.g., crosslinks)
  external     external one-body potentials.
  tether       potentials to "tether" (restrain) specific atoms.
ensembles      classes that define statistical ensembles
chemistry      classes for atoms, molecules, and covalent groups (bonds, etc.)
species        molecular species (i.e., molecular structures)
neighbor       classes that implement a cell list and a Verlet pair list
links          classes to manage crosslinks (mutable covalent bonds).
tethers        classes to manage tethers that constrain specific atoms

util           miscellaneous utilities

dox            source files for dOxygen html documentation.

Makefile targets 
----------------

The mcMd directory contains a makefile that can be used to compile all of the 
classes in the directory tree rooted at mcMd. This includes all of the classes 
in the McMd namespace.  The most important targets are available:

make all      make all *.o files in src/mcMd and its subdirectories, 
              and a static library mcMd$(MCMD_SUFFIX).a in lib/

make clean    remove all *.o files in src/mcMd and its subdirectories,
              and the static library file.
