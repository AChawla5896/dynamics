Bug: 

Symptom: Restart of perturbation does not work in McSimulations with a
HybridMd move. An error occurs when trying to load the perturbation
because the pointer to the perturbation has already been copied by the 
copy constructor. 

Discussion: The bug is avoidable by allowing for the possible that a 
System that is a copy already has a perturbation, or doesn't need one.
It is not clear whether a dependent MdSystem needs a perturbation, 
since it shares the potential energy and most other structures with 
the parent McSystem. The dependent MdSystem does not need to adjust
parameters when a perturbation is applied for potential energies that
are passed as shared pointers - both systems are then using the same
object, and so adjustment can be left to the parent. The difficult 
case is the pair potential, because the MdSystem creates a copy of 
the parent potential rather than using a shared pointer. Everything
is okay as long the perturbation is applied before the hybrid MdMove
is created, but we have not been intentional about guaranteeing that
this happens. 

Proposal: An MdSystem that is created by copying an McSystem should
not have a perturbation or replica move, but we then need to introduce
a separate mechanism for synchronizing the parameters of the 
MdPairPotential of the dependent object.
