TODO:

  - Test serialization analyzers in perturb/ in multi-processor run.

  Note: Checked 1/4/2013 with grep that all other analyzers have 
  save / loadParameters functions. Many have not been well tested.

New analyzers:

  - Write AngleDistribution analyzer for bending angle
  - Write McPairEnergyMatrixAnalyzer template
  - Write MdPairEnergyMatrixAnalyzer template

Documentation (need *.dox files):

  system/LinearRouseAutoCorr 
  system/RingRouseAutoCorr 
  mcSystem/McPressureAnalyzer

Reimplement as subclasses of more generic base classes:

  system/RadiusGyration
  system/BoundaryAverage (rename OrthoBoundaryAverage)
  mcSystem/McPairEnergyAnalyzer (and deprecate McPairEnergyAverage)
  mcSystem/MdPairEnergyAnalyzer (and deprecate McPairEnergyAverage)
  mdSystem/MdPairEnergyCoefficients (also rename and stash old version)
  mdSystem/MdPotentialEnergyAverage (also rename and stash old version)

Rename / Rewrite:

  mcSystem/McNVTChemicalPotential -> LinFlexMuAnalyzer
  mcSystem/McMuExchange -> McMuExchangeAnalyzer (rewrite)
