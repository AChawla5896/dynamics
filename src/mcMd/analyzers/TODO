TODO:

  - Test serialization analyzers in perturb/ in multi-processor run.

  Note: Checked 1/4/2013 with grep that all other analyzers have 
  save / loadParameters functions. Many have not been well tested.

New analyzers:

  - Write AngleDistribution analyzer for bending angle

Documentation (need *.dox files):

  system/LinearRouseAutoCorr 
  system/RingRouseAutoCorr 

Reimplement as subclasses of more generic base classes:

  system/BoundaryAverage (rename OrthoBoundaryAverage)
  mcSystem/McPairEnergyMatrixAnalyzer 
  mcSystem/MdPairEnergyMatrixAnalyzer 
  mdSystem/MdPotentialEnergyAverage (also rename and stash old version)

Rename / Rewrite:

  mcSystem/McNVTChemicalPotential -> LinFlexMuAnalyzer
  mcSystem/McMuExchange -> McMuExchangeAnalyzer (rewrite)
