TODO:

 - Test serialization analyzers in perturb/ in multi-processor run.

Note: Checked 1/4/2013 with grep that all other analyzers have 
    save / loadParameters functions. Many have not been well tested.

New analyzers:

  - Write DihedralDistribution analyzer for dihedral angle
  - Write AngleDistribution analyzer for bending angle
  - Write PairEnergiesAnalyzer template
  - Write McPairEnergiesAnalyzer for multiple types of pair
  - Write MdPairEnergiesAnalyzer for multiple types of pair

Documentation (need *.dox files):

  system/LinearRouseAutoCorr 
  system/RingRouseAutoCorr 
  mcSystem/McPressureAnalyzer

Deprecate (move to attic):

  mcSystem/McEnergyOutput
  mdSystem/MdEnergyOutput

Reimplement as subclasses of more generic base classes:

  system/BoundaryAverage (rename OrthoBoundaryAverage)
  system/RadiusGyration
  mcSystem/McEnergyAnalyzer
  mcSystem/McPairEnergyAverage (or deprecate after writing more general version)
  mdSystem/MdPairEnergyCoefficients (also rename)
  mdSystem/MdPotentialEnergyAverage (also rename)

Rename / Rewrite:

  mcSystem/McNVTChemicalPotential -> LinFlexMuAnalyzer
  mcSystem/McMuExchange -> McMuExchangeAnalyzer (rewrite)
