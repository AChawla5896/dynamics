TODO:

New analyzers:

  - Write AngleDistribution analyzer for bending angle

Documentation (need *.dox files):

  system/LinearRouseAutoCorr 
  system/RingRouseAutoCorr 

Reimplement as subclasses of more generic base classes:

  system/BoundaryAverage (rename OrthoBoundaryAverage)
  mcSystem/McPairEnergyMatrixAnalyzer 
  mcSystem/MdPairEnergyMatrixAnalyzer 
  mdSystem/MdPotentialEnergyAverage (also rename and stash old version)

Deprecate (redundant):

  mcSystem/McEnergyAverage
  mcSystem/McPressureAverage

Rename / Rewrite:

  mdSystem/MdPressureAverage -> MdPressureAnalyzer
  mcSystem/McNVTChemicalPotential -> LinFlexMuAnalyzer
  mcSystem/McMuExchange -> McMuExchangeAnalyzer (rewrite)

More Generic Base Classes:

  AutoCorrelation(Analyzer|Mixin)<class T>
  MeanSqDisplacement(Analyzer|Mixin)<class T>

Serialization:
 
  - Test serialization analyzers in perturb/ in multi-processor run.

  - Make sure that all analyzers restart, preferably tested within 
    the testsuite/ runs.

  Note: Checked 1/4/2013 with grep that all other analyzers have 
  save / loadParameters functions.
