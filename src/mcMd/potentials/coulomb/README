Status: This directory contains a partially working
version of the Ewald Coulomb interaction for MD, 
and notes or drafts for a proposed final version.
Luckily the names chosen for all the classes in the
first cut are slightly different for the proposed
final names. We plan to keep the old partially 
working version intact, using the old file name, 
while we are working on the new versions. The 
relevant sets of file names are as follows:

Old file names (retained for now):

CoulombPotential
CoulombSystemMixIn
EwaldCoulombPair
EwaldCoulombPotential
FineEwaldCoulombPotential
RefinedEwaldCoulombPotential

Proposed names of new files:

MdCoulombPotential
MdEwaldPotential
EwaldInteraction
EwaldRSpaceAccumulator
