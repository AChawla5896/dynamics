This directory contains two files named config.1 and config.2. 
These files contain the first and last segments of the makefiles 
that are installed in the src/, build/serial and bld/parallel
directories. The makefiles in these directories are constructed
by concatenating first config.1, then a file from the directory
src/make/compiler, and finally config.2.
