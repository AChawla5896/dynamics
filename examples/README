This directory contains examples of input files for a variety of simple polymer 
systems. The examples in the flexible/ subdirectory, which contain systems with
flexible linear polymers, are designed to work with the default version of the 
code, in which only pair and bond potentials are enabled. 

See the end of this file for a discussion of what preprocessor macros must be 
defined in order to compile versions of the code with the features needed to
run the examples in other subdirectories.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Example Directory Structure:

A directory containing an example for a single processor job typically looks 
like this:

   param
   commands
   in/
   in/config
   out/

The file "param" is the input parameter file, which the main executable reads 
from standard input.  The file "commands" is the command script. The file 
"in/config" is the input configuration file. Outputs are written to the out/ 
directory. 

Some examples are configured to write periodic configuration dumps. If present,
these are written to subdirectory out/dump/ in files with names of the form 
out/dump/config.i, where i represents an integer, giving base names config.0, 
config.1, config.2 etc. 

Some examples that are also used for purposes of validation, contain a set of 
output files produced by a previous run. If present, these outputs are in a 
directory named out_r/.  

To run the default version of the MD program interactively, with log 
information written to the screen, cd to the directory containing the relevant 
param and commands file, and enter:

     mdSim < param 

To instead send log information to a file, redirect standard output, as in

     mdSim < param > out/log

Different examples require different versions of the main mcSim (for MC 
examples) and mdSim (for MD examples) which have been compiled with different 
options enabled.  For example mdSim_a and mcSim_a are the default names of 
executables that have been compiled with angle potentials enabled, which are 
used in the examples in the examples/wormlike/ subdirectory. Other suffixes 
are added to represent other features, such _l for the link potential (mutable 
bonds), or _e for external potentials. Each of the features that is required 
to run examples can be enabled by setting one of the makefile flag variables 
in the src/mcMd/defines.mk file or (to enable parallel operation), choosing 
an mpi compiler in the src/compiler.mk file, and recompiling the program.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Subdirectories: 

Examples in different directories use versions of the code compiled with 
different options enabled.

flexible: These examples use default executables named mdSim and mcSim, which 
          have only pair and bond potentials (no angle, dihedral, link, 
          external, etc.) 

wormlike: These examples use executables mdSim_a and mcSim_a, with angle 
          potentials but no dihedral, link or external potentials. These 
          must be compiled with INTER_ANGLE defined in src/inter/defines.mk.  
          The examples are melts of short wormlike chains.

network:  These examples use executables named mdSim_l and mdSim_l with a link 
          potential, but no angle, dihedral, or external potentials. These are 
          compiled with MCMD_LINK defined in src/mcMd/defines.mk. These 
          examples are crosslinked networks of linear polymers. 

external: These examples use executables named mdSim_e and mdSim_e with 
          an external one body potential, but no angle, dihedral, or link 
          potentials. They are compiled with INTER_EXTERNAL defined in 
          src/inter/defines.mk.
